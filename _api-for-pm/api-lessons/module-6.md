## 1. Search Videos on YouTube

The first result would be this:  [https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list)

Now, you have the API reference guide. Let's read the API documentation and find out how to get our correct endpoint.
