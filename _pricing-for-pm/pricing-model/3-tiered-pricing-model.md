## 3. Tiered pricing model

All your users aren’t the same! Tiered pricing is a model where you price your product according to the needs your users have.

*Let’s see the tiered pricing model of Disney + Hotstar!*

### Characteristics of tiered pricing 🐵

1. The first plan is normally *free* with limited features.
2. The plans are arranged in an incremental manner; depending upon the features offered and usage limit. Tiered pricing is often an extension of the freemium model. *The first plan is free and the last plan has maximum features and advantages (like unlimited usage access, best streaming quality)*

### Best practices for tiered pricing 🐷

1. Always give your plans a **simple/catchy** name. *e.g:- VIP, Premium, Pro, Basic* (Shaktiman 😝)
2. Don’t overwhelm your users with a lot of choices. Show 4 options at max.*I would suggest going with 2 to 3 choices as the more choices your users have, **the harder it is for them to decide, and in turn, the less likely they are to buy**.* 
3. Nudge the users with the option you want them to buy. Highlight the plan & show them a copy like **POPULAR / RECOMMENDED** or keep the plan selected by default which you want to push.

1. Keep a clear distinction between the tiers - both in terms of pricing & features.
