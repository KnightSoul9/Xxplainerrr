## 1. Decoy pricing

### Dan Ariely & the economist case¬†study üßß

---

To understand decoy pricing, let‚Äôs take a sneak peek into Dan Ariely's famous book on behavioral economics ‚Äò[Predictably Irrational](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B002RI9QJE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)‚Äô.

In the book, Dan argues that *the human mind can only make sense of relationships and not facts by itself.*

*When we are confronted with a set of choices, the mind majorly draws* a *relationship between a set of choices & makes a decision.* üòæ

To debunk decoy pricing, let us see this economist subscription plan!

Absurd, right! Which one would you choose? *Why the hell option 3 offers more value than 2 at the same price?* üòê

Dan calls option 2 as decoy introduced to push customers to choose 3rd plan *(print + web)*! Option 2 is introduced to push more & more customers to buy option 3.

Dan Ariely also proved this empirically. In an experiment he conducted on 100 students at MIT Sloan School of Management‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää**84 opted for choice 3** (web + print plan) & only 16 opted for choice 1 (web only).

When he removed option 2‚Ää i.e. the decoy‚Äî‚Ääonly **32 opted for choice 3** (web + print plan) while 68 opted for choice 1 (web only).


>üí° Dan also didn‚Äôt stop here. He left a practical advise for all of us. üëä   When you are going for a hookup at a bar. Take an identical looking  guy  with you but make sure that he is a notch less attractive and smart   than you. You will see the magic instantly and thank Dan later. üòæ The guy you took with you is the decoy.

In a famous popcorn experiment, when small and large popcorn was sold at $3 and $7, most customers opted for a small popcorn.

But when a medium popcorn was introduced at $6.5, most customers opted for the large popcorn. The $6.5 medium-sized popcorn (decoy) does the magic in this experiment.

Popcorn experiment!
