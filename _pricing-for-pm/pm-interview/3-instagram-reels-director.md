### [Leaked] Zuck hiring for Director - Product (Instagram reels) monetisation

[Setting: Mark Zuckerberg's office. Akhil, the candidate, enters for the interview.]

**Mark Zuckerberg:** Hey Akhil, welcome! Thanks for coming in today. Let's get right into it. Why do you believe monetizing Instagram Reels is a good idea?

**Akhil:** Hi Mark, thanks for having me! Monetizing Instagram Reels offers a fantastic opportunity to expand our revenue sources beyond ads. As the platform gains immense popularity, creating unique ways to monetize Reels will attract more content creators and ensure user engagement remains high.

**Mark Zuckerberg:** Absolutely. Engagement is key. Can you give me some data on the growth of Instagram Reels and its engagement metrics?

**Akhil:** Sure, Mark! In the last quarter, we witnessed an impressive 200% increase in daily active users compared to the previous quarter. Users are spending 150% more time on Reels, indicating a strong interest in short-form video content. Additionally, we've seen an 84% increase in the number of Reels uploaded by users in the last six months.

**Mark Zuckerberg:** Those numbers are promising. Now, let's talk about your idea of a revenue-sharing model with creators. How would you determine the revenue split, and what factors would influence it?

**Akhil:** Great question, Mark! Determining the revenue split requires balancing several factors. We'll consider metrics like the number of views, engagement, and follower count for each creator. By implementing a tiered revenue-sharing approach based on performance, we can incentivize creators to produce high-quality content that resonates with our users.

**Mark Zuckerberg:** Interesting approach. Now, regarding premium features, how would you identify which ones to offer as in-app purchases, and how do we ensure they don't hinder the user experience?

**Akhil:** It's essential to strike a balance, Mark. We'll conduct user surveys to understand what features they find most appealing. Analyzing the usage data of existing filters, effects, and stickers will give us insights into which ones are the most popular. To maintain a smooth user experience, we'll implement a freemium modelâ€”keeping essential features free and offering exclusive ones as in-app purchases.

**Mark Zuckerberg:** That sounds sensible. Now, onto sponsored Reels campaigns. How can we ensure the content remains authentic and aligns with Instagram's values?

**Akhil:** Authenticity is vital, Mark. We'll establish clear guidelines and content policies for sponsored Reels to maintain consistency with our platform's values. We'll have a dedicated team that reviews and approves campaigns to ensure they don't feel forced or out of place. Transparency will be essential, and we'll ensure that sponsored partnerships are clearly disclosed to our users.

**Mark Zuckerberg:** Good thinking. Let's look ahead. What are the major milestones in your high-level roadmap for the next 12 months?

**Akhil:**

- In the first quarter, we aim to onboard 100 top creators, resulting in a 30% increase in overall Reels production.
- By the end of the second quarter, we want to develop in-app purchases for premium Reels content, targeting a 20% conversion rate from active Reels users.
- During the third quarter, we'll launch pilot sponsored Reels campaigns with select brands, closely monitoring success metrics.
- In the fourth quarter, we'll scale sponsored Reels to more brands while gathering feedback from users and creators.
- By the end of the year, we'll refine our strategies based on learnings and optimize monetization models.
- 

**Mark Zuckerberg:** A well-structured plan. How would you measure the success of these initiatives and make data-driven decisions?

**Akhil:** Data is crucial, Mark. We'll track various metrics, including revenue generated from Reels monetization, retention rates of content creators, user engagement with premium features, and the overall growth of ad revenue alongside Reels monetization. Regular A/B testing and user feedback will guide our decisions to ensure we're constantly improving.

**Mark Zuckerberg:** Good to hear that. Now, let's discuss team building. How would you build and manage the team responsible for Reels monetization?

**Akhil:** Building the right team is essential, Mark. I'll start by identifying talented individuals within the company who have experience in product monetization and growth. Additionally, I'll look for professionals who have a deep understanding of social media trends and video content consumption. Cultural fit and a passion for our mission will be critical during the hiring process. Once the core team is in place, we'll expand strategically, ensuring we have a diverse group of individuals with complementary skills.

**Mark Zuckerberg:** Diverse teams are important. Now, how would you enable experimentation to test and try new monetization ideas for Instagram Reels?

**Akhil:** Experimentation is key to innovation, Mark. We'll form a cross-functional team comprising product managers, engineers, designers, and data analysts. We'll set clear success metrics and establish a culture that encourages testing and learning from failures. A/B testing will be an essential tool to compare different monetization models and features. We'll also actively seek feedback from our users and creators to guide our experiments.

**Mark Zuckerberg:** I like your approach. Let's discuss potential risks. What do you see as the biggest risks in implementing Reels monetization, and how would you mitigate them?

**Akhil:**

- Risk: Content creators might leave if the revenue-sharing model is unattractive.
    - Mitigation: Regularly review and adjust revenue-sharing percentages based on feedback and market benchmarks to keep creators motivated.
- Risk: Introducing too many in-app purchase options might overwhelm users.
    - Mitigation: Implement a limited number of premium features initially, based on user preferences and feedback, and gradually expand based on demand.
- Risk: Sponsored Reels might compromise the platform's authenticity.
    - Mitigation: Establish strict content policies and guidelines for sponsored content, with a dedicated team for approval, ensuring sponsored content remains aligned with Instagram's values.
    

**Mark Zuckerberg:** Good analysis and mitigation plans. One final question - how would you ensure effective communication between the monetization team and other stakeholders, like advertising and content teams?

**Akhil:** Communication is key to success, Mark. We'll hold regular cross-functional meetings to align on goals and strategies. Sharing data insights and learnings from experiments will foster collaboration and a better understanding of each team's needs. By working together, we can ensure a seamless and integrated approach to Reels monetization.

**Mark Zuckerberg:** Akhil, this has been an engaging and insightful conversation. I appreciate your lively and authentic responses. You've displayed a deep understanding of our goals and potential challenges. I believe you're the right person to lead this function. Welcome to the team!

**Akhil:** Thank you so much, Mark! I'm truly excited and grateful for this opportunity. I can't wait to contribute to the success of Instagram Reels monetization!

[The interview concludes, and Akhil joins the team as the Director - Product Management for Instagram Reels Monetization.]
