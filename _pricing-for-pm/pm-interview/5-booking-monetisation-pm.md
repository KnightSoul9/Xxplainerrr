[Transcript of the [Booking.com](http://booking.com/) Product Manager Monetisation Interview]

**Interviewer:** Good morning, Alina. Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by discussing your experience with pricing models and monetization strategies for the South East Asian market. Can you share some of your past successes in this area?

**Alina:** Good morning. Thank you for having me. In my previous role, I worked on implementing dynamic pricing algorithms for a travel booking platform in the region, which resulted in a 20% increase in revenue over six months.

**Interviewer:** That's interesting. Could you elaborate on the specific factors you considered while designing those dynamic pricing algorithms? How did you ensure they were aligned with the needs of South East Asian customers?

**Alina:** Of course. We took into account various factors such as demand trends, competitor pricing, seasonality, and customer behavior in the region. Additionally, we conducted user surveys and analyzed booking patterns to understand customer preferences better.

**Interviewer:** Impressive. Now, let's dive deeper. Suppose we want to launch a new premium subscription plan in the South East Asian market. How would you determine the price point and features for this plan?

**Alina:** Well, to determine the price point, I would conduct market research to understand the willingness of customers to pay for additional features. I'd also analyze competitors' premium plans and conduct A/B testing to evaluate different pricing tiers and their conversion rates.

**Interviewer:** Okay, let's challenge that approach. South East Asia is a diverse market with varying levels of disposable income and travel preferences. How would you ensure your pricing strategy caters to these differences?

**Alina:** You're right; it's a diverse market. I would segment the customers based on their preferences and spending habits, allowing us to tailor the premium plans to different customer segments. This way, we can offer different levels of features and pricing to cater to their specific needs.

**Interviewer:** That's a good start, but how would you address the potential backlash from existing users who might feel excluded from the new premium features? And how would you handle any negative impact on user satisfaction?

**Alina:** Hmm, handling existing users is indeed crucial. I would communicate the benefits of the premium plan transparently and offer some of the most requested features to the existing users as well. Regularly seeking feedback and iterating on the offering based on their input could help maintain user satisfaction.

**Interviewer:** You mentioned iterative changes. Can you elaborate on your experience in implementing pricing changes in a live marketplace? How would you measure the success of those changes?

**Alina:** Implementing pricing changes can be challenging. In my previous role, we rolled out changes gradually to a small subset of users and monitored key metrics such as conversion rates, revenue, and customer feedback. We then analyzed the data to understand the impact of the changes and fine-tuned the pricing model accordingly.

**Interviewer:** Interesting. But what if the initial rollout resulted in a significant dip in revenue and user engagement? How would you address this situation?

**Alina:** If we encounter such a scenario, I would conduct a thorough analysis to identify the specific pain points and gather feedback from the affected users. Then, we'd swiftly revert to the previous pricing model, while proactively communicating the reasons for the change and assuring users of our commitment to providing a seamless experience.

**Interviewer:** Alright, last question. How would you assess the success of our monetization efforts in the South East Asian market in the long term? What key performance indicators (KPIs) would you use?

**Alina:** In the long term, I would focus on KPIs such as overall revenue growth, customer lifetime value, customer acquisition cost, and market share. Additionally, tracking user retention and satisfaction metrics would help gauge the effectiveness of our monetization strategies.

I**nterviewer:** Thank you, Alina. While your experience seems solid, I must say your responses lacked the level of detail and creativity we were hoping for. We are looking for someone who can think on their feet and address complex challenges with innovative solutions. Unfortunately, your answers didn't demonstrate that today.

**Alina:** I understand, and I apologize if my responses fell short of your expectations. I'm open to feedback and would appreciate any specific areas where I could improve.

**Interviewer:** Well, for starters, your approach to handling the diverse South East Asian market lacked specificity. We were looking for more targeted strategies to address the unique needs of customers in different countries. Additionally, your responses on mitigating negative impacts and measuring success were rather generic. We needed someone who could tackle these situations head-on with confidence.

**Alina:** I see. Thank you for the feedback. I will definitely take this as a learning experience and work on refining my approach.

**Interviewer:** That's good to hear. Remember, the hiring bar for this role is exceptionally high. We appreciate your time today, but we'll be moving forward with other candidates whose responses better align with our expectations. Best of luck in your future endeavors.

**Alina:** Thank you for the opportunity, and I appreciate your honesty. I'll strive to improve and showcase my capabilities better in future interviews. Have a great day.

**Interviewer:** You too. Goodbye.
