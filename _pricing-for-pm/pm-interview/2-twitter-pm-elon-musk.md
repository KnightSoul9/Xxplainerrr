### [Leaked] Elon Musk hiring for Product Manager 2 - Twitter creator monetisation

**Interview Transcript: Elon Musk (Interviewer) and Interviewee (Anikta)**

[The interview takes place in a high-tech meeting room at Tesla headquarters. Elon hasnâ€™t slept from the last 3 days. Elon Musk sits at the head of the table, and Anikta, the interviewee, is seated across from him.]

**Elon Musk:** (leaning forward) Alright, Anikta, let's cut to the chase. I want to hear your top three killer monetization ideas for Twitter that will make it the ultimate platform for creators. Fire away!

**Anikta:** (confidently) Thank you, Elon. My top three ideas are: a subscription-based content monetization model, a virtual gifts system, and a creator fund.

**Elon Musk:** (nodding) Subscription-based content, virtual gifts, and a creator fund. Interesting choices. Now, let's dive deeper into each idea. How do you envision implementing the subscription model, and how will it benefit creators while keeping users engaged?

**Anikta:** With the subscription model, we can offer users exclusive access to premium content from their favorite creators at a monthly fee. Creators can provide bonus content, behind-the-scenes access, and interactive experiences that are only accessible to their subscribers. This model not only ensures a steady revenue stream for creators but also incentivizes them to produce high-quality, engaging content to retain their subscribers.

**Elon Musk:** (leaning back) I like the exclusivity aspect, Anikta. It could drive user engagement and create a strong community around creators. How would you handle the pricing for these subscriptions? And how do we ensure it doesn't alienate users?

**Anikta:** Great question, Elon. The pricing would be flexible, allowing creators to set their own subscription rates based on the value they offer. We would also introduce a tiered system, with basic, standard, and premium subscription levels, each offering different benefits. As for not alienating users, we'd implement a trial period and make sure there's always a balance between free and premium content to cater to different user preferences.

**Elon Musk:** (smirking) Good answer. Now, onto your second idea: the virtual gifts system. How do you see this working, and what's the revenue potential?

**Anikta:** The virtual gifts system would allow users to purchase and send digital gifts to creators as a way to support them. These virtual gifts could be personalized and fun, like emojis, animations, or even unique stickers. Each gift would have a cost, and a portion of that cost would go to the creator. It's a win-win as users get to express their appreciation, and creators receive direct financial support.

**Elon Musk:** (nodding) I like the direct connection between users and creators. It fosters a sense of appreciation. But, do you see any potential challenges with this system, and how would you address them?

**Anikta:** One potential challenge could be the potential for abuse, like spamming creators with low-value virtual gifts. To tackle this, we'd implement a cooldown period between gift sends and set a minimum value for each gift to prevent spam. We'd also have reporting mechanisms in place to deal with any inappropriate behavior.

**Elon Musk:** (impressed) Well thought out. Now, let's move to your third idea: the creator fund. What's the vision behind this, and how do you propose we set it up?

**Anikta:** The creator fund would be a dedicated pool of money set aside by Twitter to financially support creators. We'd distribute these funds based on various metrics, such as engagement, content quality, and follower growth. This would incentivize creators to continue producing excellent content while leveling the playing field for new and emerging creators.

**Elon Musk:** (intrigued) Interesting approach. How do you plan to measure content quality objectively, and what measures will be in place to avoid any biases in the distribution of funds?

**Anikta:** To measure content quality, we'd analyze factors like user interactions (likes, retweets, comments), time spent on content, and perhaps even user sentiment analysis. To avoid biases, we'd use a combination of AI and human review to ensure fairness and transparency in the fund distribution process.

**Elon Musk:** (nodding) Fair and transparent, that's essential. Now, Anikta, let's take this up a notch. Twitter has some strong competitors like YouTube and Instagram. How do you propose we make Twitter the most creator-friendly platform in terms of monetization, surpassing those giants?

**Anikta:** To beat YouTube and Instagram, we need to capitalize on Twitter's strengths: real-time conversations and engagement. First, we'd offer creators better revenue-sharing terms than competitors. Second, we'd focus on building deeper connections between creators and their audience through exclusive live sessions and interactive Q&A features. Lastly, we'd leverage Twitter's vast network of influencers to attract more creators and create a sense of community.

**Elon Musk:** (leaning forward) I like your vision, Anikta. You've given this a lot of thought. One final question: how would you prioritize these monetization features in a roadmap, and what key performance indicators (KPIs) would you use to measure their success?

**Anikta:** Our roadmap would start with the subscription model, as it provides a stable revenue stream for creators and strengthens the user-creator bond. Next, we'd launch the virtual gifts system to add an element of fun and appreciation. Lastly, we'd roll out the creator fund to support diverse content creation. The KPIs to measure success would include subscriber growth, gift send frequency, and the overall increase in creator earnings.

**Elon Musk:** (leaning back, deep in thought) Anikta, you've presented some compelling ideas, but I want to dig even deeper. Let's explore the potential user growth and revenue generation of each monetization feature. Can you give me a rough estimate of the opportunity size for these initiatives?

**Anikta:** Absolutely, Elon. Let's start with the subscription model. Twitter currently has around 330 million monthly active users. Suppose we can attract just 10% of those users to subscribe to their favorite creators at an average monthly fee of $5. That would translate to approximately 33 million subscribers, generating $165 million in revenue per month. And this is a conservative estimate, considering we could have a higher adoption rate and varying subscription prices.

**Elon Musk:** (impressed) That's a significant potential revenue stream. Now, onto the virtual gifts system. How would you estimate the user adoption rate and the average spend on virtual gifts?

**Anikta:** Based on data from other platforms with virtual gifting systems, we could expect around 20% of Twitter users to engage with the virtual gifts feature. And if we can encourage an average spending of just $1 per user per month, that would add an additional $66 million in revenue each month. Again, this is a conservative estimate as Twitter's user engagement and creator base could drive even higher adoption and spending rates.

**Elon Musk:** (nodding) Very well. Now, the creator fund. How would you calculate the pool of money set aside for this initiative, and how would you ensure its sustainability?

**Anikta:** To determine the creator fund pool, we could allocate a percentage of Twitter's overall advertising revenue, let's say 10%. With Twitter's annual advertising revenue being around $3.7 billion, the creator fund would have $370 million to distribute among creators annually. To ensure sustainability, we'd monitor the fund's usage closely and evaluate its impact on creator engagement and platform growth. If needed, we can adjust the allocation percentage or introduce additional revenue sources like sponsored content programs.

**Elon Musk:** (probing further) I like your approach to the creator fund, but what if we face a scenario where the fund isn't sufficient to support all deserving creators? How would you handle that?

**Anikta:** That's a valid concern, Elon. In case the creator fund falls short, we could consider prioritizing distribution based on creators' potential and content quality. We might also explore partnerships with brands or investors who are interested in supporting creators on the platform. Additionally, we'd encourage creators to diversify their revenue streams, so they're not entirely dependent on the fund.

**Elon Musk:** (contemplating) Good thinking. Now, let's discuss the risk of implementing these features. What challenges do you foresee, and how would you mitigate them?

**Anikta:** One significant challenge could be backlash from users who are used to a completely free platform. To mitigate this risk, we'd approach the implementation with transparency, clearly explaining the benefits of the subscription model and how it directly supports creators and enhances their experience. We'd also provide ample opportunities for users to try out the premium features during trial periods to understand the value they can get.

Another risk is potential user churn if they find the subscription pricing too high or if the virtual gifts system leads to excessive spamming. To address this, we'd regularly analyze user feedback and usage data to fine-tune the pricing and gift-sending mechanisms. Furthermore, we'd be prepared to iterate quickly to improve the overall experience.

**Elon Musk:** (nodding) Solid risk assessment and mitigation plan. Let's talk about market saturation. As we roll out these features, competitors might also try to copy them. How do you propose we stay ahead of the curve and maintain our competitive edge?

**Anikta:** To stay ahead of the competition, we'd focus on continuous innovation and agility. We'd set up a dedicated team to monitor the market and analyze user feedback regularly. This team would be responsible for ideating and launching new features and improvements, ensuring that we consistently provide a superior experience for both creators and users. Additionally, we'd leverage Twitter's strong brand and influencer network to maintain our position as the go-to platform for real-time conversations and engagement.

**Elon Musk:** (impressed) I like your approach to staying ahead. One last question before we conclude. How do you plan to collaborate with the product development and engineering teams to bring these ideas to life efficiently?

**Anikta:** Collaboration is crucial for success. I would foster close communication with the product development and engineering teams from the beginning. We'd hold regular meetings to align our goals and priorities, and I'd work closely with them to ensure a clear roadmap and seamless execution. By involving all stakeholders in the decision-making process and encouraging an open feedback culture, we can create a strong, cross-functional team that drives results efficiently.

**Elon Musk:** (smiling) Anikta, you've demonstrated outstanding knowledge, strategic thinking, and problem-solving skills. I'm genuinely impressed with your vision and your ability to handle tough questions. I have no doubt you'd be a valuable addition to our team. We'll be in touch soon. Thank you for your time today.

**Anikta:** (grateful) Thank you, Elon. It's been an incredible opportunity, and I'm excited about the possibility of contributing to Twitter's success. I look forward to hearing from you.

[They shake hands again, and Anikta leaves the room, feeling a sense of accomplishment and anticipation.]
