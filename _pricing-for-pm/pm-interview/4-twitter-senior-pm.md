###  [Leaked] Elon Musk hiring for Senior Product Manager - Twitter monetisation

**Interview Room - Elon Musk and Jane sitting across the table**

**Elon:** Jane, I've heard great things about you, and I'm excited to see what you bring to the table. Let's start with a big picture question. Given the high bar for this role, what do you believe is the most significant opportunity for Twitter in the realm of creator monetization, and how would you seize it?

**Jane:** Thank you, Elon. I believe the most significant opportunity lies in redefining the creator-customer relationship on Twitter. By focusing on a data-driven, personalized approach, we can create a mutually beneficial ecosystem. My strategy involves leveraging AI and machine learning to match creators with their most engaged audience segments. This way, we can deliver highly relevant ads that resonate with users, leading to increased ad performance, better revenue for creators, and higher user satisfaction. Additionally, I would invest in building a comprehensive creator analytics dashboard, empowering creators with valuable insights to optimize their content strategy and ad revenue. This data-driven approach will set Twitter apart as a platform that truly understands and values its creators.

**Elon:** Impressive vision, Jane. Let's delve into the financials. Twitter's ad revenue is vital for our growth. How would you balance the revenue sharing model with the need to maintain our current advertiser base and attract new ones?

**Jane:** Indeed, striking a balance is crucial. To ensure the revenue sharing model doesn't negatively impact advertisers, I would propose a gradual implementation approach. We could start with a test group of creators and monitor the impact on ad performance and revenue. As we gain insights, we can make data-driven adjustments to optimize the model.

To attract and retain advertisers, I would emphasize the benefits of the revenue sharing program on user engagement. Higher-quality content from motivated creators will lead to a more active and receptive user base, translating into increased ROI for advertisers. Additionally, we could explore innovative ad formats that complement organic content, rather than interrupting it, providing a seamless user experience.

**Elon:** That sounds reasonable. Now, let's talk about international expansion. Twitter has a global user base, and we can't ignore diverse markets. How would you tailor the ad revenue sharing model to cater to creators from different regions while maintaining profitability?

**Jane:** You're absolutely right, Elon. Tailoring the model for different regions is essential. I propose conducting thorough market research to understand the unique challenges and opportunities in each region. We can then introduce region-specific revenue sharing tiers based on factors like local advertiser demand, purchasing power, and content consumption patterns.

In regions where the market is nascent, a more generous revenue split could incentivize creators to join Twitter. However, in mature markets, we may adjust the split to balance profitability while still offering an attractive proposition to creators.

Additionally, investing in regional creator support and community-building initiatives will foster a strong creator network and contribute to sustained growth in diverse markets.

**Elon:** Good point. Now, let's talk about competitive advantage. How can we ensure Twitter remains the go-to platform for creators despite the rising competition in the creator economy?

**Jane:** To maintain our competitive advantage, we must focus on building a unique and creator-centric ecosystem. One key aspect is providing exclusive tools and features to creators that enhance their ability to engage with their audience. This could include live Q&A sessions, interactive polls, or even early access to new platform features.

Moreover, we should foster a strong sense of community among creators, encouraging collaboration and cross-promotion. By positioning Twitter as the platform where creators support and uplift each other, we create an environment that's difficult for competitors to replicate.

Furthermore, staying at the forefront of technology and innovation is vital. Embracing emerging technologies like VR or AR for immersive content experiences can set us apart and attract both creators and users seeking cutting-edge interactions.

**Elon:** Innovative thinking, Jane. Let's shift focus to user experience. How do you plan to ensure that users continue to have a positive experience on Twitter, even with an increased presence of ads due to the revenue sharing model?

**Jane:** User experience is paramount. To mitigate ad fatigue, we need to maintain a delicate balance between ads and organic content. Implementing ad frequency caps will prevent overwhelming users with too many ads. Additionally, we should focus on refining ad targeting algorithms to ensure ads are relevant and valuable to users, reducing the perception of intrusive advertising.

Moreover, introducing interactive and engaging ad formats that allow users to participate or provide feedback can turn ads into valuable content experiences. Furthermore, providing users with control over their ad preferences and transparency about how their data is used will enhance trust and improve the overall user experience.

**Elon:** Sounds reasonable. Let's get back to numbers. Based on your estimates, what's the potential market size for creator monetization, and what percentage of this market do you believe Twitter can capture?

**Jane:** Estimating the potential market size requires analyzing the total creator base across various platforms and regions. Based on industry data, the global creator economy is projected to reach several hundred billion dollars in the coming years.

To capture a significant share of this market, we must capitalize on Twitter's unique strengths and focus on strategic partnerships. With the right incentives and our data-driven approach to matching creators and audiences, I believe we can attract a sizable portion of creators, aiming for at least 10-15% market share in the first few years.

**Elon:** Ambitious but achievable. Alright, Jane, we're nearing the end. As a closing question, how would you approach user feedback and iterate on the revenue sharing model to ensure its long-term success?

**Jane:** User feedback is invaluable in shaping our strategies. I would prioritize building an accessible feedback mechanism directly within the platform. Regular surveys, focus groups, and direct communication channels with creators and users will be essential to gather insights and understand pain points.

Based on feedback, we can iterate on the revenue sharing model to make it more attractive to creators while ensuring Twitter's sustainability. Data analytics will play a key role in identifying trends and opportunities for improvement. Continuous monitoring of key performance indicators will enable us to respond swiftly to any emerging challenges or opportunities, ensuring the model's long-term success.

**Elon:** Jane, thank you for sharing your well-crafted strategies and thoughtful answers. It's been an enlightening discussion. We'll be in touch soon. Expect to hear from us within the next few days.

**Jane:** Thank you, Elon. I appreciate the opportunity and look forward to further discussions. Have a great day!
