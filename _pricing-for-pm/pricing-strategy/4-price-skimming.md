## 4. Price Skimming

[Hitesh Raj Bhagat](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/blogs/GeektotheFuture/smartphone-prices-the-skimming-pricing-scheme/) in Economic Times brilliantly explains the skimming price strategy employed by mobile phone manufacturers in India.

Mobile manufacturers often leak their new mobile prices into the market &   introduce the mobiles at an artificially inflated price to those who desire and want exclusivity.

Once this layer of customers is skimmed and sales start dipping; the companies correct the sticker price.

> Skimming is launching the product at a higher cost and when the product life cycle matures; you lower the cost gradually.

### 4.1 When does price skimming work well?

- When your product has a high upfront cost
- When your product enters an unsaturated market
- When your brand has already built trust & turned premium and you are launching a new offering

> Skimming pricing makes sense in all these scenarios as we never know what’s the right price of my product/offering. It’s always better to start on a higher note. In India, slashing the price is easier. Increasing the price isn’t.

### 4.2 Pitfalls of skimming

1. **It doesn’t work at all when you are entering a saturated market**

In microeconomics, it is said that a saturated market has an elastic demand curve *i.e. a small change in price has a  large effect on buying.*

When a product enters a saturated market; it is advisable to not go for skimming pricing *(unless your product is 10x better than alternatives)* as customers would go in all directions to betray you.

1. **Skimming slows down mass adoption and attracts competitors**

Netflix entered India’s nascent OTT space in 2016 with premium pricing.

It attained a huge success in a short span but its success on high ticket price intrigued a plethora of OTT players in India - Voot (2020), Zee 5  (2018), MX Player (2019), Aree (2016) etc.

> Viable substitutes ensured that the demand curve became elastic.

Skimming also **slowed down the mass adoption of Netflix** in India and gave OTT players like Sony LIV, Zee 5, Voot time to improve their product and match their production quality and storyline to Netflix.

Eventually, Netflix had to shed a *skimming-only pricing approach* and launched their mobile-only plan at *₹* 199.
