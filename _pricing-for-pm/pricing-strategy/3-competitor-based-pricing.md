## 3. Competitor based pricing

Competitor-based pricing is simple. If you entering a market that already has multiple players; you can price your product higher/lower than your average competitor's price or just match it.

BSNL Fibre launched *(in Oct 2020)* exactly one year after Jio Fibre & Airtel Xtreme Fibre offered almost identical prices for the same offerings.

1. **Higher-than-average price** ➡  ****When you want to signal luxury or a promise of 10x better product to potential customers.
2. **Lower-than-average price** ➡ When you’re trying to undercut the competition and acquire customers quickly.
3. **Match-the-average price** ➡ When you want to signal that you are offering a better product/service at an identical price & want to grab a pie of the market.
