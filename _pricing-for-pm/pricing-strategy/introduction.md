Whenever I see India‚Äôs consumer internet space, I get more & more convinced that pricing is like an infinite jigsaw puzzle - *extremely difficult to crack*.

Incidentally, I had created a course on [APIs for Product Managers](https://www.apiforpm.tech/) before. While talking to users who purchased by course, pricing was the most demanded topic for next e-bok.

*That made me write an e-book on pricing.*

BTW, pricing is a complex phenomenon. It‚Äôs a mix of microeconomic principles, marketing theories, and human psychology.

> Micro-economics + Marketing + Human psychology ‚û° Pricing
> 

So, I have decided to break this series on pricing into 3 parts -

- Part 1 *(Classical economics)* ‚û° Pricing strategies for consumer tech companies
- Part 2 *(Marketing)* ‚û° Pricing models for consumer tech companies
- Part 3 *(Human psychology)* ‚û° Powerful pricing psychology hacks

## 1. Pricing strategies for consumer tech companies

I was reading Katherine Paine the other day. Katherine (CMO at News Group) made a very interesting observation on pricing *(that almost blew my mind) - ‚Äò*The moment you make a mistake in pricing, you‚Äôre **eating into your reputation** or **your profits**.‚Äô

- What if you price your product less than *what it should be*? Maybe, you are leaving money on the table.
- What if you price your product more than *what it should be?* Maybe, you are losing out on sales.

*Okay!* But what‚Äôs that sweet spot? *A price that generates maximum sales & revenue?*

I wish pricing was a purely mathematical concept and had a simple answer like if you send a rocket with a minimum of 11.2 km/sec; it will escape the earth‚Äôs gravitational field but *pricing is as much an art as it‚Äôs a science.*

In the [use case podcast](https://turnaround.substack.com/p/pricing-strategies-for-startups) with Ravish Bhatia, Dr. Sreelata Jonnalagedda *(Associate Professor at IIM B),* pitches a very basic *(yet powerful)* model to price a consumer tech product. She calls it **3C + O model**

*‚ÄúYou should know your costs, customers, competitors, and objectives to fix your price.‚Äù*

- Cost ‚û° You should know what your costs are.
- Customers ‚û° You should know what your customers are willing to pay.
- Competitors ‚û° You should know what your competitors are offering.
- Objectives ‚û° What are you trying to achieve with your pricing?
    
    *Are you building yet another food delivery app and want to enter an already crowded market or are you building a new category and are the first in the market?*
    

*Okay, wait!* What if you know all these four inputs **(3C + O)** well? Can you use a mathematical formula & tell me about your pricing in a second.  The answer is No. *Pricing isn‚Äôt that simple! I wish it was like -* üí©**

## 2. What are common pricing strategies?

Standard textbooks mention 5 common pricing strategies. Knowing these strategies helps you to frame your pricing at a broader level.

1. Cost-based pricing
2. Competitor based pricing
3. Value-based pricing
4. Price Skimming
5. Penetration pricing

PS:- I haven‚Äôt covered classical microeconomics theory like **supply, demand, elasticity curves, etc**. It hardly comes in handy in real-life scenarios.

Let's deep dive into the course.
