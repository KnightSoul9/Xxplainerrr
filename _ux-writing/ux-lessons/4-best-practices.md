## How do you solve error states, empty states, placeholder texts?


Error states are an essential part of any user interface. They occur when a user makes a mistake or enters invalid information, and the system needs to communicate the issue to the user. In my UX Writing experience; I’ve figured out the main principles that every error copy should address.

- Be specific and clear: explain the problem and how to fix it. Avoid using vague messages like "error occurred" or "invalid input."
- Use plain language: Avoid technical jargon or complex terminology. Remember that users may come from different backgrounds and may not be familiar with technical terms.
- Be empathetic: Use a friendly and helpful tone that acknowledges the user's frustration. Don’t play the blame game.
- Offer a solution: Suggest a fix or offer guidance on how to correct the error.
- Test and iterate: Once you've written error messages, test them with real users to see if they're effective. Continuously iterate and refine your messages based on feedback and user behaviour.

I’ve developed a formula to write such error messages; and it worked for 99% of solutioning.

**Explain the issue/status + give a solution/ provide next step details**

For e.g; Incorrect password. Please check and retry after a minute.

Here is an example of good error text.

Twitter explains to users the error and gives a solution and alternative fix.

## 5.2 Empty States

---

Never ever underestimate the power of empty states. With the right approach, you can encourage the user to take action or even make them feel better about not doing anything. When I think of empty states, I think of 'feel-good' spaces."

Here are a few things which you can keep in mind while writing for empty states.

- Show the benefit: Use empty states as an opportunity to show the user the potential benefit of taking action. This can include highlighting the value of the app's features or showcasing how others have benefited from using the app.

E.g; twitter nudging to write a post

- Use visual cues: Visual cues can help the user understand what the empty state represents and what action they should take. For example, use images or icons that indicate the purpose of the screen or button.

- Make it engaging: An empty state doesn't have to be boring. Use humour or creative language to make the experience more engaging and memorable.

- Personalise the experience: Personalise the empty state based on the user's behaviour or preferences. For example, if the user has not yet completed a certain task, suggest they do so to improve their experience.

## 5.3 Placeholder texts

---

Placeholder text is a temporary text that is displayed in a form field or a search bar until the user enters their own content. It serves as a visual cue and provides guidance to the user on what type of information is expected to be entered in that field. Placeholder text is commonly used in web and mobile interfaces to help users understand what information they need to provide.

This helps users in understanding with

- What to do
- Follow formats, if any
