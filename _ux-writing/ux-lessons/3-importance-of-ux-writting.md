## Why UX Writing is important for your company/team?

*– Yes we’re talking experience and retention*

The role of UX copy in an early stage and the growing company becomes considerably more significant. Growth for the company is reflected directly in *user retention and *product engagement.

- The better the UX of the product the higher the *user conversion rate.

Research carried out by Toptal shows that 88% of users are less likely to return to a website with bad UX. Even one negative experience can go a long way in determining the retention of the user.

Talking in terms of copy issues, these negative experiences can come from

- poorly written calls to action
- misleading or confusing instructions
- robotic and impersonal error messages that are high on jargon and fail to convey information to the user.
- repetitive, redundant and exhaustingly long copies.

In our increasingly fast world of instant gratifiers, users don't want to read too much or spend one extra second accomplishing a task.

The goal then is not just to make the user experience good but constantly and competitively better.

*Even if UX Writing saves a lot of money, why are some companies with no ux writers sustaining at the top of their category?*

For legacy products and larger companies, success comes easier due to less competition at their level, large user base, the established market of product fit and many times being the only available option.

As companies grow they drive out and eliminate competition by different means, even if it means incurring initial loss or low revenue. For growing companies that advantage is far off and creating a good product is one of the keys to their success. A good UX understands the user behaviour, empathises with their pain points and eliminates their doubts/concerns.

If we were to be naive and convince ourselves that the design alone would be enough, that it will be understood by the users exactly as intended by the designer, we are about to join the club of product managers/stakeholders* who learnt the truth the harder way.

This is, to sum up our average users and their interaction with the design of everyday things. It is then upon the *UX writer to label the butterfly before users can jump to questions, confusion or conclusions.*

A UX Writer's job is to

- clarify uncertainties during the product experience
- empathises with users at every step and also drive engagement and increase conversion.
- Defining voice & tone & making sure it’s consistent throughout.

A very important aspect of UX writing is that it reflects the voice of the brand. For a growing company, it is imperative to find and assert the brand voice and create user personas. The consistency of language is crucial to a good experience.

The UX Writer defines the voice of the brand and sees through the implementation of the same. To create a voice is to find the balance between humour and ridicule, instruction and cognitive overload, and informing and shaming the user. A brand's voice is also its principle of inclusivity and accessibility and reflects in its UX copy. There is an increasing expectation from products and services everywhere to show more respect and inclusivity. People only do business with brands they are comfortable with. That’s why the experience created by writing matters. The UX Writer / Content designer then becomes the gatekeeper of everything content, contributing to the overall user experience. This experience is the driving force behind Product led growth coveted by every company. You’ll learn more about tone & voice in the later chapter.
