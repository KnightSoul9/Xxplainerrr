## Understanding tone & voice

In UX writing, voice and tone refer to the way a brand communicates with its users. Voice is the personality and style of the brand, while the tone is the attitude or emotion expressed in a particular message. Here are some key points to keep in mind when considering voice and tone in UX writing:

- The voice should be consistent across all touchpoints to create a cohesive brand experience.
- Tone can vary depending on the context and the user's emotional state.
- A brand's voice should be unique and distinguishable from competitors.
- Tone can be used to express empathy and connect with users on an emotional level.
- Voice and tone should reflect the brand's values and messaging strategy.
- UX writers should work closely with designers and product managers to ensure that voice and tone are incorporated consistently throughout the user journey.

UX writers create engaging, emotionally rich experiences for users using chosen voice & tone.

## How does one prepare a voice or tone style guideline style?

- Persona: UX writers often create user personas, which are fictional characters that represent the target audience of the brand. This is to understand the personas' characteristics, motivations, and needs.
- Language: The choice of language can also affect the voice and tone of the brand. Using slang or jargon, for example, can make the brand seem more casual or authoritative, respectively. The level of formality and complexity of the language should be appropriate to the target audience and the context of the interaction.
- Brand personality: A brand's personality should inform the voice and tone of its UX writing. For example, a brand that's playful and irreverent may use a more casual tone, while a brand that's professional and authoritative may use a more formal tone.
- User needs and preferences: The voice and tone of UX writing should be tailored to the needs and preferences of the target users. For example, a finance app may need a more serious tone to convey trustworthiness, while a social media app may use a more lighthearted tone to encourage engagement.
- Context of use: The voice and tone of UX writing should be appropriate for the context in which it will be used. For example, an error message should use a more empathetic tone to convey understanding, while a confirmation message can use a more celebratory tone to convey excitement.
- Product goals: The voice and tone of UX writing should align with the product goals. For example, if the goal is to increase user engagement, a more conversational tone may be used to encourage interaction.
- Industry norms: The voice and tone of UX writing should be consistent with the norms of the industry in which the product operates. For example, a healthcare app may need to use a more formal tone to convey authority and trustworthiness.

Keeping these points in mind, one can create a Voice and tone for their product but Iâ€™ll also mention some Style Guidelines which have helped me to create one for myself. You can also consider adopting their guidelines instead of creating one.
