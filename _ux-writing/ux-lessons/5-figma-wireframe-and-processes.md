# Figma wireframe & processes

In my experience of experimenting with different tools, I have found Figma to be the best UX writer-friendly tool. Here’s why -

1. Easy to collaborate
2. Quick to learn
3. Amazing plugins to ease the work
4. Working directly on designs helps the writer to understand how the copy is fitting.

Hence making it an efficient choice for the UX Writers out there. If you’re a beginner, just start up by editing the design and you’ll surely get your way into it. However here is also a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY0EfWjndQg) that can help you to learn Figma as it is a must if you want to be a UX Writer or are a stakeholder wanting to collaborate on the designs.

## 6.1 What is a wireframe?

---

- Wireframes are visual representations of a website or app's structure and layout.
- They are typically created in the early stages of the design process to establish the basic structure and functionality of a product.
- They help designers and developers and other stakeholders to focus on the functionality and usability of a product, rather than its aesthetics.

## 6.2 How do you contribute to wireframe as a UX Writer?

---

1. Design the words: Write the text that appears on the wireframes such as headings, subheadings, body text, labels, buttons, and error messages.
2. Collaborating with the design team: Ensure that the copy you write fits into the wireframes and doesn't disrupt the overall user experience.
3. Conducting usability testing: Conduct usability testing* to evaluate the effectiveness of the wireframes and the copy you've written, and make changes based on user feedback.

## 6.3 Processes in UX Writing

---

This largely depends from company to company. What works for a UX Writer in a Fortune 500 company might not work for a UX Writer in a seed-fund startup so the process varies but if you’re the first UX Writer and want to start from scratch. Here are a set of steps that you can follow.

1. Sit next to the designer (V important, so you don’t miss out)
2. Get requirements from the product owner/ stakeholders
3. Understand what is required from a communication point of view. Point out things, which are missing
4. Map your understanding, either with conversational mapping or product framework.
5. Finalise your story and brainstorm with the designer (with wireframing)
6. Re-iterate the copy. Talk to users. Do usability testing. Change copy accordingly.
7. Review once the design is in the final stage and freeze the same.
8. Collaborate with QA to review copy once again on the tech-built stage.

That’s it. That’s the process. It can be 6,7 depending upon your company or even 9 for that matter of fact.
