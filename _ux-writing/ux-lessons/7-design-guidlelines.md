Do you know? I live by this motto, “Content first design for the win”. And yes, this has come full circle and I must say that without content the world is blank, it’s sort of every emotion and carries nothing.

But what is content-first design? Content-first design is easy. It means, first you design/develop/decide the content and then you design everything else. Of course, if there is a screen where the product owner wants the user to post something or listen to some songs unless I content-design it saying “ Write something for your friends” Post *share*; You won’t know what to design.

So basically

- The idea behind the content first design is that the content of a website or application is its most important element and that the visual design should be created to serve the content, rather than the other way around.

- By focusing on the content first, designers can create more effective and engaging designs that meet the needs of users.

- Content-first design typically involves creating content before creating wireframes or visual designs and using the content to inform the layout and structure of the design.

- Content-first design often involves working closely with content creators, such as writers and editors, to ensure that the content is appropriate for the audience and supports the goals of the design.

- Content-first design can help designers create more accessible designs, as it focuses on creating content that is clear, concise, and easy to understand.

- Content-first design can also help designers create more flexible designs, as it allows for changes to the content without affecting the visual design.

- Content-first design can be especially useful for complex or data-heavy applications, where the content is particularly important and needs to be presented clearly and effectively.

It’s a no-brainer that it’s a powerful approach to creating effective and engaging designs that put users' needs first. Unless the design is for infants, who won’t be able to consume those words so you draw a little cartoon, telling them where to tap.

I, however, very much like to use conversation mapping as it helps me to create a user-centred content strategy. It answers a lot of questions, while you’re doing the whole conversational exercise and it can be called as a content-first design approach.

Here’s an example


### Goal -  Help a user buy a dress

**User:** Hello, I'm looking to buy a dress.

**X:** Great! Before we can proceed, can you please log in to your account or create a new one?

**User:** I don't have an account. How do I create one?

**X:** It's easy! Just click on the 'Create Account' button and follow the steps.

**User:** Okay, I've created an account. What's next?

**X:** Perfect! Now let's find that dress you're looking for. Do you have any particular style in mind?

**User:** I'm looking for a red midi dress for a wedding.

**X:** Great choice! We have several options in red midi dresses. Would you like me to show you some options?

**User:** Yes, please.

**X:** Here are a few options for you to choose from. Once you've made your selection, add it to your cart and proceed to checkout.

**User:** I've found the perfect dress! How do I purchase it?

**X:** Excellent! Just click on 'Add to Cart' and then proceed to checkout. You'll be asked to enter your shipping and payment information before confirming your purchase.

**User:** That sounds easy enough. Thanks for your help!
