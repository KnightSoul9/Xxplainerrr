## UX Writing: Chasing the right words

What comes to your mind when someone talks about design?

Most often people visualize components such as buttons, tooltips, coloured boxes, funny icons, illustrations, and placements. However, words play an equally important role in app design. In fact, a whopping 60% of the design is all about "words" or as we call it today, UX Writing.

In this book, I'll delve into how UX Writing is the driving force behind app design and how it can enhance the customer experience tenfold. My name is Richa Chaturvedi, and as a UX writer with three years of experience, I've noticed that many people don't fully understand what UX writing entails. Some people may confuse it with editing, reviewing, or even translating.

However, UX writing is a unique discipline that is fundamentally different from these roles. At its core, UX writing is about selecting the right words that can guide and direct users through an app, making it user-friendly and intuitive. By collaborating closely with designers, UX writers can ensure that the language used in an app complements the visual design and creates a seamless experience.

In essence, UX writing is the hidden gem of app design, and it has the power to take the user experience to a whole new level. With carefully crafted words and phrases, UX writers can create a connection with users and make an app feel like second nature.

And I couldnâ€™t agree more!

## 1. What is UX Writing?

---

Let's just imagine,

An airport, with world-class infrastructure and amenities. The finest example of what architecture could achieve. But this epitome of excellence has no signboards or texts. Simply no text content anywhere in sight. No matter how well-built the terminals are, how timely the flights are, or how clean the place is, you can't navigate without signs or boards. What makes a good architecture navigable is the usability of the structure.

If we remove the words from the below sign board, it would be just mindless arrows and coloured boxes. This is what UX Writing is. To give the ability to navigate through a complex structure.

In the absence of written signs, we will be lost and left asking for directions every five minutes. We don't realise the importance of texts until they are not there. Just like the airport, every product and design needs guiding texts for the best experience.

This is the essence of UX writing - it's all about providing users with the right words and phrases that help them navigate through an app or website with ease. By crafting language that is clear, concise, and engaging, UX writers can create a seamless experience that feels intuitive and effortless. The result is an app or website that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also highly functional and user-friendly.

Letâ€™s see another example of UX Writing in an app experience.

MailChimp is famous for its quirky and elaborative approach to writing. Theyâ€™re human in the way of explaining things, making sure that the user achieves the goal without making any errors. Here, for the Password setting, as the user is entering the particular character, the words are getting highlighted; thus making this copy.

- Human experience
- A rewarding feeling
- Navigational tone

## 1.2 UX Writing: Saving Millions & Building Revenue

Found this quote in one of my favourite books on UX Writing -Â  "If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design." â€” **Dr.** **Ralf Speth (CEO, Jaguar)**

UX Writing is precious. The biggest breakthrough in tech UX was when e-commerce saved hundreds of millions of dollars by just adding a simple explanation; famously known as the $300,000,000 Fix. See the picture of the change below. Read about it [here.](https://articles.uie.com/three_hund_million_button/)

In the world of buzzwords, UX has been making waves for quite a while. But what does it mean to create the user experience and why should you care about it? A user's experience is their end-to-end journey from product discovery to successful use of the intended flows.

While marketing and sales can get the users onboard and introduce them to the product, it is the experience that makes them stay. The goal of creating good user experiences is to retain the users for the foreseeable future.

A good UX copy should answer questions that users might ask when they look at the interface or the product.
