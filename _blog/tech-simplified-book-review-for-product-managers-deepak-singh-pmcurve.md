Btw, if you are looking to learn Technology as a Product Manager with hands-on exercises and case studies instead of reading a book (which is usually boring); do check out the cohort Tech For PM (rated 9.3/10) by Venkatesh Gupta (Product Manager - Razorpay) [here](https://www.xplainerr.com/cohorts/tech-for-product-managers).

## Amazon ratings & reviews üçû

Let‚Äôs check out some reader‚Äôs feedback on Amazon:

**Vikrant**, an engineer with extensive domain experience, struggled to understand software/hardware terms when interacting with software teams. He found existing resources time-consuming and wished for a handy reference. He praises Deepak's book for fulfilling this need, summarizing complex tech topics in simple language. He recommends it for:

1. Product managers new to tech domains.
2. Entrepreneurs, product/project managers needing to communicate with technical teams.
3. Anyone seeking a basic understanding of tech advancements driving digital transformation.

Vikrant believes this book shortens the learning curve for those seeking basic tech knowledge.

Another reader, **Sushmita**, thinks that Tech Simplified for PMs by Deepak Singh is a must-read for people who lead tech teams but have a limited tech background. She says that these people often get lost in tech jargon and concepts.

I hope you find the review useful. :)
