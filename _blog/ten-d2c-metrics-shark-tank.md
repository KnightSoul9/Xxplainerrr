## 🦈 What is D2C and Shark Tank India connection?

---

"D2C" stands for "Direct-to-Consumer," which refers to a business model in which a company sells its products or services directly to the end consumer, rather than going through intermediaries such as retailers or wholesalers.

In recent years, we have seen a surge of D2C brands appearing on the show. This is because the D2C model has become increasingly popular in India, as it allows businesses to have more control over their brand and customer relationships, as well as to collect valuable data and feedback directly from consumers.

Furthermore, the D2C model allows businesses to bypass the traditional retail distribution channels, which can be costly and time-consuming, and instead leverage digital marketing and e-commerce platforms to reach customers directly. This can lead to greater efficiency and cost savings, as well as the ability to offer more personalized and targeted marketing.

One example of a successful D2C brand is Mamaearth, a personal care brand that offers natural and toxin-free products for mothers and babies. The company has grown rapidly in India by leveraging the D2C model, and has also expanded into international markets.

Let’s look at top 10 important D2C metrics-

### 🍮 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

---

This is the cost of acquiring a new customer, including marketing expenses. For example, if a company spends Rs. 500 on marketing and acquires 10 new customers, then the CAC is Rs. 50.

### 👨🏻 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

---

This measures the total revenue a customer is expected to generate over their lifetime with the company. For example, if a customer spends Rs. 1000 per year with a company and stays for 5 years, then their CLV is Rs. 5000.

### 🏆 Conversion Rate

---

This measures the percentage of website visitors who take a desired action, like making a purchase. For example, if 100 people visit a website and 10 make a purchase, then the conversion rate is 10%.

### 👯 Average Order Value (AOV)

---

This measures the average amount spent by a customer in a single transaction. For example, if 10 customers each spend Rs. 500 in a single transaction, then the AOV is Rs. 500.

### 🧑🏻‍🍳 Churn rate

---

This measures the percentage of customers who stop doing business with a company over a given time period. For example, if a company has 100 customers and loses 10 in a month, then the churn rate is 10%.

### 💗 Gross margin

---

This measures the percentage of revenue that remains after deducting the cost of goods sold. For example, if a company sells a product for Rs. 100 and it costs Rs. 50 to make, then the gross margin is 50%.

### 🍠 Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)

---

This measures the revenue generated for every rupee spent on advertising. For example, if a company spends Rs. 1000 on ads and generates Rs. 5000 in revenue, then the ROAS is 5.

### 🌑 Net Promoter Score (NPS)

---

This measures customer satisfaction and loyalty by asking how likely they are to recommend a product or service. For example, if a company has an NPS of 60, then 60% of customers are likely to recommend the company.

### 🥸 Customer Retention Rate

---

This measures the percentage of customers who continue to do business with a company over a given time period. For example, if a company has 100 customers and retains 80 of them in a month, then the retention rate is 80%.

### 🧑🏻‍💻 Inventory Turnover

---

This measures how quickly a company sells and replaces its inventory. For example, if a company sells 100 units of inventory in a month and has 200 units in stock, then the inventory turnover is 0.5.

### 🎗️Use-cases

---

Here are some examples of how different types of D2C companies could use these metrics:

- A clothing brand could track AOV to see if customers are spending more or less over time.
- A subscription service could track churn rate to see how many customers are cancelling each month.
- A beauty brand could track customer retention rate to see how many customers are returning to make repeat purchases.
- A food delivery service could track conversion rate to see how many website visitors are placing orders.
