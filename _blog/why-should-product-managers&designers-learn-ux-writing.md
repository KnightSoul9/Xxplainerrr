## ✍🏻 What is UX writing?

---

UX writing stands for User Experience writing. It refers to the process of crafting the text or content that appears in a digital product such as websites, apps, or software. The goal of UX writing is to create clear, concise, and effective messaging that guides users through the product and helps them achieve their goals.

UX writing is an important aspect of user experience design because it directly impacts how users interact with the product. Good UX writing helps users understand the product's features, how to use them, and what benefits they offer.

Let's take an example from the Spotify app to explain the difference between good and bad UX writing.

❌ **Bad UX Writing Example:**
If the copy for the 'search' bar on the Spotify app says "Type here to search", it's not very helpful. The copy is too generic and doesn't provide any context to the user about what they should search for. It doesn't guide the user and can lead to frustration and confusion.

✅ **Good UX Writing Example:**
On the other hand, if the copy for the 'search' bar on the Spotify app says "Search for songs, artists or albums", it's much better. This copy is more specific and provides clear guidance to the user about what they can search for. It's also concise and easy to understand, making it more effective in helping users achieve their goals.

In summary, UX writing plays an important role in creating a positive user experience by providing clear and effective messaging that guides users through the product.

## 👉🏻 Why should Product Manager & Designers learn about UX writing?

---

Product managers and designers should learn about UX writing because it is an essential component of user experience design. A well-crafted UX copy can make the difference between a user being able to use a product with ease or becoming frustrated and giving up.

UX writing helps to create a cohesive experience for users by ensuring that the messaging is consistent across all touchpoints of the product. It also helps to reduce confusion and increase usability, making the product more user-friendly and ultimately more successful.

Let's take an example from Booking.com and Gmail to illustrate the importance of UX writing.

🌴 **Booking.com Example:**
On Booking.com, the copy for the "Check Availability" button could simply say "Check Availability." However, a more effective UX copy would be "Check Availability and Prices." This additional wording is crucial for users because it lets them know what to expect after clicking the button. It also saves users time by giving them all the information they need in one place.

✉️ **Gmail Example:**
In Gmail, when a user tries to send an email without a subject line, a message appears that says "Subject is empty." While this is technically correct, it's not the most user-friendly copy. A better option would be to say "Please add a subject to your email." This copy is more helpful because it tells the user what to do next and helps them complete the task more efficiently.

In conclusion, product managers and designers should learn about UX writing to improve the usability and user experience of their products. Effective UX copy can make a significant impact on user engagement and satisfaction, ultimately leading to greater success for the product.

## 🥳 Core UX writing principles

---

There are several principles that guide UX writing, but here are the top five:

## 👓 Clarity

The language used should be clear and easy to understand. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that might be unfamiliar to the user.

❌ **Bad example**: "Sorry, the page cannot be rendered at this time due to an error. Please try again later."

✅ **Good example**: "Oops, something went wrong. Please try again later."

## 🤱🏻 Brevity

Keep the text concise and to the point. Users have limited attention spans and don't want to read long paragraphs.

❌ **Bad example**: "In order to complete the registration process, you need to fill in all the required fields. This includes your name, email address, password, and date of birth."

✅ **Good example**: "Please fill in all required fields to register."

## 🚧 Consistency

Use consistent language throughout the product to avoid confusing users. Use the same words to describe the same actions or features.

❌ **Bad example**: "Click here to search" vs. "Search here"

✅ **Good example**: "Search for products" (used consistently across the product)

## 🤴🏻 Empathy

Use language that shows empathy towards the user. Address their needs and concerns and guide them towards a solution.

❌ **Bad example**: "Invalid username or password"

✅ **Good example**: "Oops, it looks like your username or password is incorrect. Please try again."

## 📚 Context

Provide contextual information to guide the user and help them understand what they need to do.

❌ **Bad example**: "Error: 404"

✅ **Good example**: "Sorry, we couldn't find the page you were looking for. Please check the URL or try searching for it."

In summary, good UX writing is clear, concise, consistent, empathetic, and provides context to the user. It helps users achieve their goals with minimal effort and frustration, leading to a positive user experience.

## 🌎 Case studies

---

Let’s see some examples of what a good vs bad UX writing is.

## 📅  Google Calendar

❌ **Bad example**: "Event creation failed"

✅ **Good example**: "Oops! Looks like something went wrong. Please try again."

**Explanation**: The bad example is too technical and doesn't provide any useful information. The good example is more user-friendly and empathetic, acknowledging that something went wrong and offering encouragement to try again.

## 💰Stripe

❌ **Bad example**: "Error: 400"

✅ **Good example**: "Sorry, we couldn't process your payment. Please check your payment information and try again."

**Explanation**: The bad example is too technical and doesn't provide any useful information. The good example is more user-friendly and provides guidance on what went wrong and what the user can do to fix it.

## 🥅 Netflix

❌ **Bad example**: "There was an error. Please try again."

✅ **Good example**: "We're having trouble playing this title right now. Please try again later or select a different title."

**Explanation**: The bad example is too generic and doesn't provide any useful information. The good example is more specific and provides guidance on what the user can do next. It also acknowledges the issue and offers a solution.

## 🚖 Uber

❌ **Bad example**: "Driver not found"

✅ **Good example**: "Sorry, we couldn't find a driver in your area. Please try again later or select a different pickup location."

**Explanation**: The bad example is too abrupt and doesn't provide any guidance on what the user can do next. The good example is more user-friendly and provides options for the user to try again later or select a different pickup location.

    - ❌ Bad example: "Feature only for premium members."
