## Interview Transcript


Transcript of Interview between Bhavish Agarwal (Bhavish) and Pari (Interviewee):

[Bhavish Agarwal (Bhavish) and Pari (Interviewee) are sitting in a meeting room at Ola headquarters.]

**Bhavish:** (Looking stern) Pari, let's get right to it. As you know, our cancellation issue in Bangalore is a serious problem. We are losing customers and revenue because of it. How would you address this as a Product Manager?

**Pari:** (Nervously) Thank you, Bhavish, for this opportunity. I believe to tackle the cancellation issue, we need to understand the root causes. I would start by analyzing data to identify patterns and reasons behind cancellations. Then, we can work on targeted solutions to address each cause.

**Bhavish:** (Frowning) That's a generic answer. We already have some data on cancellations. Tell me, which specific metrics would you analyze, and how would you prioritize the causes?

**Pari:** (Trying to regroup) Of course, Bhavish. To prioritize, I would consider the frequency of each cause and its impact on customer experience and revenue. High-frequency and high-impact issues would be tackled first. Metrics such as cancellation rates, time of cancellations, and reasons provided by users would be crucial for analysis.

**Bhavish:** (Crossing his arms) Fair enough. Now, let's assume you identified the top reasons for cancellations. How would you go about designing a solution?

**Pari:** (Gaining confidence) To design a solution, I would involve cross-functional teams, including engineering, UX, and customer support. We would conduct brainstorming sessions and user interviews to generate ideas. Then, we can create prototypes and test them through A/B experiments.

**Bhavish:** (Nods) Okay, let's get into the specifics. One of the major issues is that customers often cancel when they have to wait for a long time for a ride. How do you propose to tackle this?

**Pari:** (Thinking) We could implement an intelligent prediction system that analyzes demand patterns and suggests optimal pick-up locations for drivers. This would reduce ETA and minimize waiting times for customers.

**Bhavish:** (Unimpressed) We already have a basic version of that in place. It's not enough. What else can you come up with?

**Pari:** (Racking her brain) Perhaps we could introduce incentives for drivers to stay online during peak hours, encouraging them to be available when the demand is high.

**Bhavish:** (Skeptical) And what if drivers manipulate the system by accepting rides and then canceling them to take advantage of the incentives?

**Pari:** (Pausing) We could introduce penalties for drivers who repeatedly cancel rides after accepting them. By implementing a fair and transparent policy, we can discourage such behavior.

**Bhavish:** (Nods) Okay, let's move on to another issue. Sometimes, customers cancel because they can't find the driver, and there's a lack of communication. How would you tackle this?

**Pari:** (Eagerly) We could enhance the in-app communication between drivers and passengers. Real-time updates on the driver's location and estimated arrival time would keep customers informed. Additionally, we could offer a "Call the Driver" feature for critical situations.

**Bhavish:** (Seeming interested) That's a good start, but what if the driver is unresponsive or the call feature doesn't work?

**Pari:** (Thinking on her feet) We could implement a system that automatically detects unresponsive drivers and reassigns the ride to the nearest available driver. This way, we ensure customers don't have to wait unnecessarily.

**Bhavish:** (Nods again) Let's talk about user behavior. Some customers habitually book multiple rides and then cancel all but one. How can we address this misuse?

**Pari:** (Confidently) To discourage this behavior, we could introduce a progressive penalty system for users who frequently abuse cancellations. For instance, after a certain number of excessive cancellations, they would face longer waiting times or higher cancellation charges.

**Bhavish:** (Looking stern again) I'm not convinced. The existing cancellation charges haven't deterred such users. Why would your approach be any different?

**Pari:** (Pausing to think) You're right. We need a more robust solution. In addition to the progressive penalties, we could implement a user education program, explaining the negative impacts of such actions on the overall ride-hailing ecosystem.

**Bhavish:** (Nods) Alright, Pari. You have some decent ideas, but I'm still not convinced you understand the gravity of the issue. This is a significant problem that requires innovative thinking. Let me show you how I would tackle it.

**Pari:** (Nervously) Sure, Bhavish. I'd love to hear your thoughts.

**Bhavish:** (Leaning forward) Firstly, we need to leverage our technology to the fullest. I would invest in cutting-edge AI algorithms to accurately predict ride demand in real-time. This would enable us to have more drivers available when and where they are needed the most, reducing wait times significantly.

**Pari:** (Impressed) That sounds promising.

**Bhavish:** (Continuing) Additionally, we could introduce a subscription model for frequent users, where they get priority access to drivers during peak hours. This would incentivize them to stick with Ola and reduce the likelihood of cancellations.

**Pari:** (Nods) I see the value in that approach.

**Bhavish:** (Passionate) But we can't stop there. Our customer support needs an overhaul too. We should have a dedicated team monitoring cancellations and reaching out to affected customers proactively, addressing their concerns and offering compensation where appropriate.

**Pari:** (Engaged) That's a customer-centric approach, indeed.

**Bhavish:** (Smiling) Exactly. And lastly, we need to foster a strong driver community. Happy drivers mean more reliable service for our customers. I'd implement driver engagement programs, benefits, and support to ensure they are motivated to stay with Ola.

**Pari:** (Feeling motivated) I'm impressed with your vision, Bhavish.

**Bhavish:** (Leaning back) Thank you, Pari. See, this issue demands a comprehensive approach. As a Product Manager, you need to think big and act decisively. I need someone who can take this problem head-on and deliver results. Do you believe you're up for this challenge?

**Pari:** (Determined) Yes, Bhavish. I might not have all the answers now, but I'm eager to learn and work relentlessly to tackle this issue. I'm passionate about making a positive impact on the Ola platform.

**Bhavish:** (Smirking) Well, you certainly have the enthusiasm. I'll give you credit for that. This interview has gone longer than planned, but I appreciate your perseverance. We'll get back to you with our decision soon.

**Pari:** (Grateful) Thank you, Bhavish. I appreciate the opportunity to present my ideas and learn from your insights. I look forward to the next steps.

[The interview concludes, and Pari leaves the room, feeling both challenged and motivated by the intense interview experience at Ola headquarters.]
