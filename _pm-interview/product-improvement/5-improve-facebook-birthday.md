**[Transcript of Zoom Interview]**

**Interviewer (Steve Won):** Hello, Juli. Thank you for joining us today for the interview. I hope you're doing well.

I**nterviewee (Juli):** Thank you, Steve. I'm excited to be here and discuss the Product Manager position at Meta.

**Steve Won:** Great to hear that. Let's jump right in. As you may know, we've been experiencing a decline in engagement on Facebook, particularly among the 16-38 age cohorts. One area we'd like you to focus on is improving Facebook birthday. How would you approach this challenge and increase engagement by 50% within the next year?

**Juli:** I understand the importance of engaging the younger age groups and I believe there are a few strategies we can implement to achieve the target. Firstly, we should enhance the overall user experience when it comes to birthday notifications and celebrations. By making the process more personalized and interactive, users will feel a stronger emotional connection with the platform.

Secondly, we can introduce innovative features such as AR filters and stickers that users can apply to their birthday posts, stories, or even during video calls with friends and family. This will add an element of fun and creativity to birthday celebrations and encourage users to actively participate.

Additionally, we can leverage data analytics to understand user preferences and suggest more relevant gift ideas or events for each user's birthday. This can lead to increased user engagement and participation in the platform.

**Steve Won:** Those are some interesting ideas, Juli. Enhancing the emotional connection and user experience seems crucial. How would you prioritize these features and strategies within the one-year timeframe? We want to ensure we see tangible improvements in engagement.

**Juli:** Absolutely, prioritization is key for success. I would start by conducting user surveys and analyzing data to identify the pain points and preferences of our target age groups. Based on this research, we can prioritize the features that have the highest potential for impact.

For instance, if the data suggests that personalized birthday notifications are crucial to engagement, we should focus on that first. Following that, we can progressively introduce AR filters and stickers, as well as the data-driven birthday gift and event suggestions. This way, we can iteratively measure the impact of each feature and optimize as needed.

**Steve Won:** That sounds like a data-driven and iterative approach, which is what we need. Now, let's talk about the impact on net revenue. As a Product Manager, your decisions should contribute to the company's financial success. How do you plan to make an impact on Meta's net revenue while working on improving Facebook birthday?

**Juli:** Increasing net revenue requires a holistic approach that aligns with the overall business objectives. While improving Facebook birthday's engagement, there are a few revenue-focused strategies we can implement:

1. **Targeted Advertising:** By understanding user preferences through data analysis, we can offer more targeted advertising opportunities to businesses and brands. This will improve the effectiveness of ad campaigns and attract advertisers willing to pay a premium to reach engaged and relevant audiences.
2. **Monetizing Virtual Gifts and Experiences:** We can introduce virtual gifts and special birthday experiences that users can purchase for themselves or gift to others. These can be augmented reality gifts, exclusive filters, or even access to premium birthday events, generating additional revenue streams.
3. **Partnerships with Local Businesses:** Collaborating with local businesses to offer personalized birthday deals, discounts, or special promotions can increase footfall and boost advertising revenues.
4. **Subscription Services:** Introducing premium subscription tiers with additional birthday-related features and benefits could encourage users to upgrade and contribute to recurring revenue.
5. 

**Steve Won:** Those are solid revenue-focused strategies, Juli. I like the idea of targeted advertising and monetizing virtual gifts. It shows you've considered different avenues to drive revenue.

**Juli:** Thank you, Steve. I firmly believe that a strong focus on user experience and engagement will naturally translate into increased revenue opportunities.

**Steve Won***:* Indeed, happy users are more likely to be engaged users. Alright, we're nearing the end of our interview. Is there anything else you'd like to add or any questions you have for me?

**Juli:** I appreciate the opportunity to discuss my ideas with you today. I have one question - How does Meta approach innovation and experimentation within the Product Management team?

**Steve Won:** At Meta, we foster a culture of innovation and encourage our Product Managers to think outside the box. We believe in conducting experiments, gathering data, and iterating on ideas to find what resonates best with our users. We have a collaborative and agile environment where ideas can be tested and validated. Our teams have the autonomy to make data-driven decisions while keeping the user's needs at the forefront.

**Juli:** That's wonderful to hear. It aligns well with my approach to product management. Thank you for providing that insight.

**Steve Won:** You're welcome, Juli. It was a pleasure talking with you today. We'll be in touch soon regarding the next steps in the hiring process. Have a great day!

**Juli:** Thank you, Steve. I look forward to hearing from you. Have a great day too!
