## Interview Transcript



**Interviewer (Dimple):** Good morning! Thank you for coming in for the Flipkart product manager interview. Are you ready to dive into a scenario-based question?

**Interviewee:** Good morning, Dimple! Yes, I'm all set. I'm excited to tackle the scenario-based question.

**Interviewer (Dimple):** Great! Here's the scenario: You notice that the cart addition rate on Flipkart has dropped by 40% in the past month. As a product manager, you need to investigate this decline. Please walk me through how you would approach this situation, covering the use cases that are typically addressed in a product Root Cause Analysis (RCA).

**Interviewee:** Sure, let's break this down step-by-step. The first thing I would do is gather more data to understand the situation better. I'll look at the user metrics for the past month and compare them with the previous months to confirm the 40% drop in cart additions.

**Interviewer (Dimple):** Excellent! Understanding the data is crucial. Once you've confirmed the drop, what would be your next step?

**Interviewee:** The next step would be to identify the possible causes for this decline in cart additions. I would consider the following use cases typically addressed in a product RCA:

**1. User Experience:** I'll analyze the user journey on the platform to see if there have been any significant changes that might impact the cart addition process. This could involve examining UI changes, page load times, or any errors that users might encounter.

**2. Seasonal Trends:** I'll investigate if the drop is consistent across all products or specific to certain categories. Seasonal trends can often influence user behavior, and understanding this can help narrow down the cause.

**3. Competitor Analysis:** It's essential to keep an eye on our competitors. I'll look into whether any competitors have introduced new features, discounts, or promotions that might have led some users away from our platform.

**4. Marketing and Promotions:** I'll review the marketing and promotional activities conducted during the past month. Any changes or lack of promotional offers might have affected user engagement.

**5. Technical Issues:** I'll work with the engineering team to ensure there are no technical issues impacting cart additions, such as site downtime, slow loading times, or payment gateway problems.

**Interviewer (Dimple):** That's a comprehensive approach! Once you've analyzed these aspects, how would you proceed?

**Interviewee:** After analyzing these aspects, I would move on to validating potential reasons by conducting user surveys and feedback analysis. This can provide insights directly from users and help prioritize the issues based on their impact and frequency.

**Interviewer (Dimple):** Great! And what if the root cause is identified in one of these areas? How would you proceed with the solution?

**Interviewee:** If the root cause is identified, I'll collaborate with the relevant teams, such as design, engineering, and marketing, to develop a plan to address the issue. We'll prioritize the fixes based on their impact and feasibility of implementation.

**Interviewer (Dimple):** Excellent! One last question before we wrap up: How would you ensure that the solution you implement is effective in resolving the decline in cart additions?

**Interviewee:** To ensure the effectiveness of the solution, I'll closely monitor the metrics after implementation. A/B testing can be useful to compare the performance of the previous version with the updated one. Additionally, continuous user feedback and iterative improvements will be crucial to refining the solution further if needed.

**Interviewer (Dimple):** That sounds like a solid plan! You've covered all the essential aspects of a product RCA. Well done!

**Interviewee:** Thank you, Dimple! I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this scenario with you.

**Interviewer (Dimple):** It was my pleasure. Thank you for your thoughtful responses, and we'll be in touch soon with the next steps in the interview process. Have a great day!

**Interviewee:** You too, have a great day! Goodbye!
