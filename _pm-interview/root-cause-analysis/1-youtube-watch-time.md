## Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** Hi David, thank you for joining me today. I'm excited to have this discussion with you. As you know, we're currently facing a decline in YouTube watch time, and we'd like to dive into a root cause analysis to understand why this might be happening. Let's start by discussing your approach to this problem.

**[David]:** Hello, thank you for having me. I'm eager to help with the analysis. To start, I'd like to clarify the feature that was recently launched and understand its UI and functionality.

**[I](https://chat.openai.com/Goodbye!)nterviewer:** Great, the feature that was launched is a new video discovery algorithm that recommends videos based on user engagement and comments. Now, let's move on to the metrics. We are calculating the watch time as the total time users spend watching videos on YouTube.

**[David]:** Understood. Do we have the exact metric numbers and averages during this period when the watch time decreased?

**[I](https://chat.openai.com/Goodbye!)nterviewer:** Yes, during the period when watch time decreased, the average watch time per user per day went down by approximately 15%. We noticed this change was consistent across various geographies and user demographics.

**[David]:** Thank you for the information. Now, let's explore potential reasons for this decrease. Externally, we should consider if there were any recent launches from competitors that might have impacted YouTube's overall watch time. Additionally, it's essential to examine if there have been any changes in the composition of videos, such as shorter videos becoming more popular.

**[I](https://chat.openai.com/Goodbye!)nterviewer:** Those are good points. So far, we haven't identified any significant external factors affecting watch time. Now, let's delve into internal aspects. The feature was launched alongside several other updates. We also noticed that the new algorithm seemed to prefer short videos over longer ones. However, there were no intentional changes to the UI that we are aware of.

**[David]:** Interesting. I'd like to clarify further if this preference for short videos was an intended design or if it was due to a bug in the system.

**[I](https://chat.openai.com/Goodbye!)nterviewer:** It was not an intended design. It seems like a bug caused the algorithm to prioritize short videos over longer ones.

**[David]:** That's a crucial finding. Additionally, did users engage more with video comments than the actual videos, potentially leading to lower watch times?

**[I](https://chat.openai.com/Goodbye!)nterviewer:** Yes, that's a possibility. We noticed an increase in comment engagement during the same period when watch time decreased.

**[David]:** Thank you for that insight. Now, let's explore if there were any uncontrollable factors that might have influenced the decrease in watch time.

**[I](https://chat.openai.com/Goodbye!)nterviewer:** We haven't identified any specific external factors that were out of our control, but we'll continue to investigate.

**[David]:** Alright, it's essential to consider any external factors that might not have been immediately apparent. We should keep monitoring the situation.

**[I](https://chat.openai.com/Goodbye!)nterviewer:** Definitely, ongoing monitoring is crucial. David, I want to commend you on your thorough and well-structured approach to this root cause analysis. You've shown a strong understanding of the various factors that could contribute to the decline in watch time. Your framework was excellent, and I appreciated the way you considered both internal and external factors.

**[David]:** Thank you so much for your kind words. I'm glad I could contribute to the analysis. I believe understanding the bigger picture and considering all possible factors is essential to finding a solution.

**[I](https://chat.openai.com/Goodbye!)nterviewer:** Absolutely, I completely agree with you. Your approach and responses have been impressive, and I'm sure you'd make a valuable addition to our team. We'll continue the investigation and keep you informed of any updates. Do you have any questions or anything else you'd like to add?

**[David]:** I don't have any further questions at the moment. I appreciate the opportunity to be part of this interview process, and I'm looking forward to the possibility of joining the team. If there are any follow-up questions or additional information needed, please feel free to reach out.

**[I](https://chat.openai.com/Goodbye!)nterviewer:** Thank you, David. We'll be in touch soon. Have a great day!

**[David]:** You're welcome, and you have a great day too! Thank you again for the opportunity. Goodbye!
