## Interview Transcript


**Interviewer:** Good morning. Today, we have a challenging task for you. Imagine you're a Product Manager, and we want you to design a fridge specifically for kids. How would you approach this?

**Interviewee:** Good morning. I would start by conducting extensive research to understand the specific needs and preferences of kids and their parents when it comes to a fridge designed for children.

**Interviewer:** Research is essential, but how do you plan to gather insights from kids, who might not be articulate in expressing their needs?

**Interviewee:** You're right; kids might not be as articulate, so I would engage in child-friendly research methods like playful workshops and focus groups to observe their interactions and gather valuable feedback indirectly.

**Interviewer:** Hmm, playful workshops? Sounds like a waste of time to me. And how do you plan to make this fridge stand out from regular fridges?

**Interviewee:** The fridge would have an interactive and colorful user interface with simple icons and symbols that kids can easily understand. Additionally, I would integrate educational elements like numbers, shapes, and healthy food facts to make it both entertaining and informative.

**Interviewer:** Colors and icons might make it look like a toy, not a functional appliance. How would you address parents' concerns about the fridge's practicality and energy efficiency?

**Interviewee:** I understand the importance of practicality. The fridge would have adjustable shelves to accommodate various food items, and it would be designed with energy-efficient components to minimize energy consumption.

**Interviewer:** Energy-efficient components? That's not very innovative, is it? And what about safety concerns? Kids can be curious and might tamper with the fridge's mechanics.

**Interviewee:** Safety is indeed a top priority. I would implement childproof features like lockable compartments for potentially hazardous items, and the fridge's mechanics would be safely enclosed to prevent any accidents.

**Interviewer:** Childproof features may add complexity and cost. Are you sure parents would be willing to pay extra for this fridge?

**Interviewee:** It's crucial to strike a balance between safety and affordability. I would conduct market research to determine a reasonable price point and ensure that the added safety features are within an acceptable cost range.

**Interviewer:** I'm not convinced that this fridge would be practical or financially viable. And I have serious doubts about your approach to child-friendly research. I'll be providing negative feedback on your performance.

**Interviewee:** I'm sorry to hear that. I believe my approach considers the needs of both children and parents while addressing safety concerns. I'm open to any suggestions for improvement.

**Interviewer:** I'll take your response into consideration. Thank you for your time today.
