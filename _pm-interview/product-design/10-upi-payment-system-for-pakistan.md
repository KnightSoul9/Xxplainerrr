## Interview Transcript


**Ashneer Grover:** Good morning, Yash! Welcome to the interview. Today, we're going to explore your expertise in fintech and APIs while designing a UPI payments system for Pakistan. Are you ready for the challenge?

**Yash:** Good morning, Ashneer! Thank you for having me. I'm excited and absolutely ready to dive into this fascinating challenge.

**Ashneer Grover:** Fantastic! Let's start with the problem statement. Pakistan's payment landscape needs a makeover. How would you define the problem we're trying to solve with our UPI system?

**Yash:** Indeed, the problem is quite clear. We aim to create a modern and efficient UPI system that enables swift and secure transactions for individuals and businesses in Pakistan. The goal is to enhance financial inclusion, reduce cash dependency, and foster economic growth through digital payments.

**Ashneer Grover:** Spot on, Yash! I like your clarity. Now, let's discuss how we'll measure the success of our UPI system once it's up and running in Pakistan. What are the key metrics we should be tracking?

**Yash:** Success metrics are essential to gauge our impact. We'll track the number of active users and merchants on the platform, transaction volume, and the average transaction value. Additionally, customer satisfaction surveys will provide valuable insights into the user experience. We can also measure the percentage reduction in cash transactions to assess our progress towards financial inclusion.

**Ashneer Grover:** Excellent! You've covered all the vital metrics. Now, let's delve into the design of the UPI payments architecture for Pakistan. How would you approach building this system from the ground up?

**Yash:** Building a robust UPI system involves multiple layers of infrastructure. Firstly, we need a centralized payment switch that connects all participating banks and payment service providers. This switch will facilitate seamless fund transfers across various accounts. Each user will have a virtual payment address (VPA) linked to their bank account, providing a secure and simplified payment process. To enhance accessibility, we should enable both mobile and web-based platforms for users and merchants. Additionally, we'll implement two-factor authentication and biometric verification for secure transactions.

**Ashneer Grover:** Very comprehensive approach, Yash! I like the emphasis on security and usability. Now, let's shift gears and discuss the availability and uptime of our UPI system. How would you ensure it remains operational around the clock?

**Yash:** To ensure high availability, we'll deploy a distributed architecture with multiple redundant data centers strategically placed across Pakistan. Load balancers and failover mechanisms will distribute traffic and ensure seamless continuity in case of server failures. Additionally, we'll have a dedicated team monitoring the system 24/7 and a robust disaster recovery plan to mitigate potential risks. We'll also conduct regular maintenance to keep the system in top-notch shape.

**Ashneer Grover:** Great thinking, Yash! High availability is crucial for a smooth user experience. Now, let's explore the regulatory aspects. How would you approach obtaining necessary approvals and collaborating with banks and financial institutions in Pakistan?

**Yash:** Obtaining regulatory approvals requires a meticulous approach. We'll start by thoroughly researching the legal and compliance requirements for payment systems in Pakistan. Collaborating with banks and financial institutions would involve showcasing the benefits of our UPI system, demonstrating how it complements their existing services, and offering technical support during the integration process. Building strong relationships through open communication and mutual understanding will be key to gaining regulatory support and bank collaborations.

**Ashneer Grover:** Excellent, Yash! You've demonstrated a deep understanding of the regulatory landscape and the importance of building partnerships. Now, let's wrap up with a broader view. How do you envision the impact of our UPI system on Pakistan's economy and society?

**Yash:** Our UPI system has the potential to drive significant positive change. By reducing cash transactions and promoting digital payments, we'll enhance financial inclusion, especially in underserved areas. This increased accessibility to financial services will empower individuals and businesses, leading to economic growth. Moreover, the ease of digital payments can potentially reduce corruption and enhance transparency in financial transactions, benefiting society as a whole.

**Ashneer Grover:** Well said, Yash! You've demonstrated a strong understanding of the bigger picture and the potential impact of our UPI system. Overall, you've done exceptionally well in this interview, showcasing your expertise in fintech and APIs. It's been a pleasure speaking with you!

**Yash:** Thank you so much, Ashneer! I thoroughly enjoyed discussing this challenging project with you. I'm excited about the possibility of contributing to BharatPe's vision and making a meaningful impact in Pakistan's payments landscape.
