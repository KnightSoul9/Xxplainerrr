## Interview Transcript


**Interviewer (Ashneer Grover):** Welcome! I'm Ashneer Grover, and I'll be conducting this product manager interview for BharatPe. Let's begin! Can you please introduce yourself?

**Interviewee (Rashmi):** Thank you, Ashneer. I'm Rashmi, and I have a background in product management and engineering. I've been passionate about developing solutions that cater to the needs of people, especially in urban environments like India.

**[DISCUSSING THE PRODUCT IDEA]**

**Ashneer Grover:** Great to have you here! So, let's dive into the question. How would you design a product for moving within cities in India?

**Me:** Sure! I would propose a smart and sustainable urban mobility solution called "CityHop." It's an app-based platform that integrates various modes of transportation, including buses, metro trains, electric scooters, and even carpooling services. Users can plan their journeys efficiently by selecting the best route and mode of transport for their needs.

**Ashneer Grover:** Okay, sounds like a common idea so far. How are you planning to make it unique?

**Me:** Absolutely, great point! CityHop will be different by providing real-time data on the availability of vehicles and seats in public transportation. It will offer personalized route recommendations based on user preferences like shortest travel time, cost, or eco-friendly options. Additionally, the app will allow users to pay for all the services through integrated payment options, including digital wallets and UPI.

**Ashneer Grover:** Alright, that's interesting. But what about traffic congestion and pollution in Indian cities? How will your product address those issues?

**You:** Those are critical concerns, and CityHop aims to be part of the solution. The app will promote the use of public transport and eco-friendly options, such as electric scooters, which can reduce individual carbon footprints. Moreover, we'll collaborate with city authorities to optimize public transport routes and schedules based on data analysis, which can help reduce traffic congestion.

**[CRITICAL FEEDBACK AND SARCASTIC COMMENTS]**

**Ashneer Grover:** Hmmm, I'm not convinced yet. I mean, we have so many transportation apps already, and traffic in Indian cities is like a never-ending puzzle. Do you really think your CityHop can make a significant impact?

**Me:** I understand your concern, and you're right; it's a challenging problem. However, I believe that CityHop's emphasis on real-time data and integration of multiple modes of transportation will offer users a seamless experience. By promoting eco-friendly options and optimizing public transport, we can gradually shift people's behaviors toward more sustainable choices.

**Ashneer Grover:** *sarcastically* Oh, yes, because people in India just love changing their habits, don't they? Anyway, what about the infrastructure? You can't just snap your fingers and make the roads wider or magically improve public transportation, can you?

**Me:** Of course not! Improving infrastructure is undoubtedly a long-term goal that requires collaboration with local governments and transportation authorities. While CityHop can't directly change the infrastructure, it can help highlight the demand for better transportation services. By providing valuable data insights, we can support city planners in making informed decisions about infrastructure improvements.

**[ALTERNATIVE VIEW]**

**Ashneer Grover:** Alright, I see some potential in your idea, but let me propose an alternate view. Instead of focusing on integrating existing modes of transport, what if we push for an all-electric micro-mobility solution? Picture this - a fleet of electric rickshaws with dedicated charging stations, providing convenient short-distance travel within cities. We could partner with local rickshaw drivers and incentivize them to go green. What do you think?

**Me:** That's actually an intriguing alternative! Electric rickshaws could indeed be a game-changer for short-distance travel in Indian cities. They are compact, environment-friendly, and already a familiar mode of transport for many people. By providing charging infrastructure and incentives, we can encourage rickshaw drivers to adopt electric vehicles and promote sustainable urban mobility.

**[CONCLUSION]**

**Ashneer Grover:** Well, it's been an interesting discussion. I appreciate your effort in presenting your CityHop idea, and I must say, your answers were thorough. Remember, in the world of product management, we always have to consider multiple perspectives and adapt our solutions to the ever-changing landscape. Keep refining your ideas, and you'll do great! Thanks for joining us today.

**Me:** Thank you, Ashneer! I appreciate the opportunity to share my ideas and receive valuable feedback. It was a pleasure discussing these concepts with you. Have a great day!
