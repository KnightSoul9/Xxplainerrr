## Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** Good morning, Adam. Thank you for joining us today for the product management interview at Instagram. Today, we'd like you to design a TikTok-like application. Are you ready to begin?

**Adam:** Good morning, thank you for having me. I'm definitely excited to take on this challenge. Please, go ahead.

**Interviewer:** Great! Let's start with the problem statement. What is the problem we're trying to solve with this TikTok-like app?

**Adam:** The problem we aim to address is the growing demand for short-form, entertaining video content that engages users and keeps them coming back for more. We want to create a platform where users can easily create and share fun, creative, and engaging videos with a diverse global audience.

**Interviewer:** Excellent. Now, let's talk about the goals and success metrics. What specific goals do you think we should set for this product, and how will we measure its success?

**Adam:** Our primary goal is to become the go-to platform for short-form video content, achieving high user engagement and retention. Key success metrics could include the number of daily active users, the average time spent per user, user-generated content creation rates, and the number of viral videos that garner a significant number of views.

**Interviewer:** Good. Assumptions play a crucial role in product development. What assumptions are we making when designing this TikTok-like app?

**Adam:** Some of the assumptions we are making are that users are interested in short-form video content, that they enjoy participating in content creation, and that they prefer a user-friendly, intuitive interface for video creation and sharing. Additionally, we assume that the app's algorithms can effectively recommend relevant content to keep users engaged.

**Interviewer:** Very thoughtful. Now, let's discuss prioritization. Considering the vast scope of features, how would you prioritize the key functionalities in the app?

**Adam:** Prioritization is critical for building an MVP effectively. I would prioritize the core features like video recording and editing, user profiles, content discovery, and social interactions such as likes, comments, and sharing. Also, it's crucial to ensure the app is performant and can handle a large user base from the start.

**Interviewer:** Good strategy. Competitor analysis is vital. Who are the main competitors, and what differentiates our app from them?

**Adam:** The main competitors in this space would be TikTok itself, YouTube Shorts, and potentially Instagram Reels. To differentiate our app, we need to focus on a seamless user experience, powerful video editing capabilities, smart content recommendations, and a strong emphasis on fostering a positive and inclusive community.

**Interviewer:** Very well thought out. Now, let's move on to the Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy. How would you approach launching this TikTok-like app to gain a substantial user base quickly?

**Adam:** The GTM strategy would involve targeted marketing campaigns, influencer partnerships, and collaborations with content creators to generate initial buzz. Additionally, we would leverage Instagram's existing user base to cross-promote the new app. Offering incentives for early adopters and creating viral challenges could also help drive user acquisition.

**Interviewer:** Impressive. Finally, let's talk about the revenue model. How would you monetize this app while keeping users engaged and happy?

**Adam:** To maintain a positive user experience, we could initially focus on in-app advertising, but we must ensure that ads are not intrusive and are relevant to the users' interests. As the app gains traction, we can introduce premium features like exclusive filters, effects, and analytics for content creators, along with a subscription model. Sponsored challenges and branded content could also be potential revenue streams.

**Interviewer:** That's a well-rounded revenue model. Great job, Adam. Now, I have three clarifying questions. Firstly, what measures would you take to address potential user privacy and security concerns?

**Adam:** User privacy and security are of utmost importance. We would implement robust data protection practices, provide clear and transparent privacy settings, and obtain user consent for data usage. Regular security audits, encrypted data transmission, and multi-factor authentication would be some additional measures.

**Interviewer:** Excellent. Secondly, how would you handle the issue of copyright infringement and ensure that users only upload content they own?

**Adam:** Copyright infringement is a critical issue in user-generated content platforms. We would implement a robust content moderation system that uses both automated tools and human moderators to review content. We can also have a clear reporting mechanism for copyright claims and take swift action when necessary.

**Interviewer:** Sound approach. Lastly, how would you tackle potential issues of cyberbullying and hate speech on the platform?

**Adam:** Creating a safe and positive community is essential. We would implement strict community guidelines and use AI-based content analysis to detect and remove harmful content. Encouraging users to report inappropriate behavior, and having a team dedicated to reviewing and responding to reports would be important steps in addressing these issues.

**Interviewer:** Your responses have been excellent, Adam. Thank you for your thoughtful approach and well-structured answers.

**Adam:** Thank you for the opportunity to tackle this challenge. I've enjoyed the discussion, and I hope my ideas align with Instagram's vision.

**Interviewer:** We'll certainly take your ideas into consideration. We'll be in touch with you soon regarding the next steps. Have a great day, Adam!

**Adam:** Thank you, and have a great day too!
