## Define north star metrics for Google Calendar 

<YoutubeView id="og1_2bJmECU"/>


North Star metrics are key performance indicators (KPIs) that represent the most critical and overarching measure of success for a product or service. For Google Calendar, the North Star metrics should capture the core value it provides to users and align with its primary purpose as a time management and scheduling tool. Here are some potential North Star metrics for Google Calendar:

1. **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**: The number of unique users who actively engage with Google Calendar on a monthly basis. This metric reflects the app's popularity and user engagement.

2. **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: The number of unique users who actively use Google Calendar on a daily basis. DAU measures the app's stickiness and how frequently users rely on it to manage their schedules.

3. **Event Creation Rate**: The average number of events or appointments created by users per day. A high event creation rate indicates that users are effectively using the calendar to manage their time.

4. **Event Completion Rate**: The percentage of scheduled events that are completed or marked as done. A high completion rate suggests that users are effectively managing and following through with their commitments.

5. **Time Spent on the App**: The average amount of time users spend on Google Calendar during each session. This metric indicates the app's level of user engagement and usefulness.

6. **Event Reminder Set Rate**: The percentage of events for which users set reminders. This metric shows how well users are utilizing the app's reminder feature to stay organized and on top of their schedule.

7. **User Retention Rate**: The percentage of users who continue to use Google Calendar over a specific period, such as monthly or yearly. High user retention is a sign of app stickiness and satisfaction.

8. **Integration Rate with Other Google Services**: The percentage of users who integrate Google Calendar with other Google services, such as Gmail. This indicates how well Google Calendar complements other Google products and enhances the overall user experience.

9. **Cross-Platform Usage**: The number of users who access Google Calendar on multiple devices (e.g., desktop, mobile, tablet). This metric highlights the app's accessibility and usability across various platforms.

10. **User Feedback and Satisfaction**: Measured through surveys, ratings, and reviews, this metric reflects user satisfaction and sentiment towards Google Calendar.

**Shortlisted North Star Metric: Daily Active Users (DAU)**

### Detailed Reasoning

The Daily Active Users (DAU) metric is chosen as the North Star metric for Google Calendar because it directly reflects the app's core value proposition and is indicative of high user engagement and utility. Here's a detailed explanation of why DAU is the most crucial metric for Google Calendar:

1. **Real-Time Engagement**: DAU measures the number of unique users who actively use Google Calendar on a daily basis. This metric provides a real-time view of how frequently users interact with the app to manage their schedules and appointments. High DAU indicates that users rely on the app for their daily time management needs.

2. **Dependency on the Product**: Google Calendar's primary purpose is to help users organize their schedules and plan their day effectively. The frequency of daily usage is a strong indicator of how essential the app is to users and the level of dependency they have on it.

3. **User Habit Formation**: A high DAU suggests that users have formed a habit of checking their schedules and creating events on Google Calendar regularly. Habitual usage increases the app's stickiness and makes it a fundamental part of users' daily routines.

4. **Retention and Long-Term Value**: The DAU metric is closely related to user retention. If users are actively engaging with Google Calendar every day, it indicates that the app is providing long-term value and meeting their ongoing scheduling needs.

5. **Effectiveness of Features**: Consistent DAU growth can also indicate that the app's features, such as event creation, reminders, and integration with other Google services, are effectively meeting users' expectations and needs.

**Different Scenarios:**

1. **High DAU with Steady Growth**: In this scenario, Google Calendar experiences a consistently high DAU with steady growth over time. This indicates that the app has a loyal user base, and it is successfully attracting new users. The product is likely fulfilling its core value proposition and effectively addressing user pain points.
2. **Declining DAU**: A decline in DAU suggests that users are finding alternatives or the app is losing its relevance over time. This scenario requires a careful analysis of user feedback and product performance to identify issues and make necessary improvements.
3. **Seasonal Variations**: Google Calendar may experience fluctuations in DAU based on factors like holidays or vacation periods when users' scheduling needs change. Understanding these seasonal variations can help in better catering to users' requirements during different times of the year.
4. **Spikes in DAU**: A sudden spike in DAU may be due to a new feature release, a successful marketing campaign, or an increase in overall demand for time management tools. Analyzing the cause of the spike helps the product team capitalize on positive trends and maintain momentum.

In conclusion, Daily Active Users (DAU) is a critical North Star metric for Google Calendar as it directly represents the app's core value, user engagement, and long-term retention. Consistently monitoring and analyzing this metric will help the product team make informed decisions and continuously improve the app's performance and user experience.
