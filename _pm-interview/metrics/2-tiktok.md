Defining success for TikTok can be based on various key performance indicators (KPIs) and objectives that align with the company's goals. Here's how success for TikTok could be defined:

1. **User Engagement:** TikTok's success can be measured by the level of user engagement on the platform. Metrics like daily active users (DAUs), time spent on the app, and frequency of app opens are crucial indicators of how well the platform is retaining and engaging its audience.
2. **Content Creation:** The success of TikTok can also be gauged by the number and quality of user-generated content. High levels of creativity, diversity, and a steady influx of new content creators contribute to the platform's success.
3. **User Retention and Churn:** Retaining users and minimizing churn is vital for long-term success. TikTok needs to monitor metrics like user retention rate and churn rate to ensure that users find value in the platform and keep coming back for more.
4. **Monetization:** As a business, TikTok's success can be measured by its ability to generate revenue through various monetization methods, such as advertising, sponsored content, and in-app purchases. Revenue growth and profitability are important indicators of success in this aspect.
5. **Global Reach and Market Penetration:** TikTok's global expansion and its ability to penetrate new markets successfully are essential for its overall success. Metrics like the number of countries it operates in and its market share in each region can be used to measure this aspect.
6. **Brand Equity:** TikTok's brand perception and equity are also critical indicators of success. Positive brand sentiment, recognition, and customer loyalty are essential for building a strong and sustainable brand.
7. **Impact on Pop Culture:** TikTok's success can be attributed to its influence on pop culture and the broader society. The platform's ability to shape trends, music, and internet culture signifies its impact and relevance.
8. **Data Privacy and Security:** With a growing focus on data privacy, TikTok's success includes its ability to address concerns related to data security and user privacy. Maintaining trust among users and regulators is vital for the platform's continued success.

Overall, success for TikTok is a combination of user-centric metrics, business performance, and its broader societal impact. Regular monitoring and analysis of these KPIs help the company make data-driven decisions and continuously improve its platform to meet user expectations and business goals.
