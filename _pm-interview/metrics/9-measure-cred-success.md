## Interview Transcript


CRED is a financial technology startup based in India that aims to reward credit card users for paying their bills on time. It was founded in 2018 by Kunal Shah. CRED primarily operates as a mobile app that allows users to manage their credit card payments and earn rewards points called "CRED Coins" when they pay their credit card bills through the app.

**Business Model:**
CRED's business model revolves around partnering with credit card companies and financial institutions. They earn revenue through a combination of methods, including:

1. **Transaction Fees**: CRED charges a fee to credit card companies for processing bill payments through their platform.
2. **Commission**: CRED may earn a commission or referral fee when users avail certain financial services or products offered by partner companies.
3. **Advertising**: The app may also generate revenue through advertising partnerships, where brands can promote their products or services to CRED's user base.

**North Star Product:**
CRED's North Star product is its mobile app platform itself. The app provides a convenient and user-friendly interface for managing credit card payments, rewards, and financial services. By creating a seamless experience for credit card users, CRED aims to encourage responsible credit card behavior and timely bill payments.

**Business Metrics:**
To measure the success of CRED, several key metrics are considered:

1. **User Base**: The number of registered users and the growth rate of new users are crucial indicators of the app's popularity and reach.
2. **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**: The number of unique users who actively engage with the app on a monthly basis reflects the app's stickiness and user retention.
3. **Bill Payment Volume**: The total value of credit card bills paid through the CRED app demonstrates the app's effectiveness in driving bill payments and influencing user behavior.
4. **Reward Redemption**: The rate at which users redeem their earned CRED Coins for rewards shows how compelling the reward system is and how engaged users are with the platform.
5. **Customer Satisfaction**: User reviews, ratings, and feedback can provide insights into customer satisfaction and the overall app experience.
6. **Retention Rate**: The percentage of users who continue using the app over a specified period indicates the app's ability to retain its user base.
7. **Revenue and Profitability**: CRED's financial performance, including revenue growth, profitability, and the ability to sustain its business model, is crucial for long-term success.
8. **Partnerships**: The number and quality of partnerships with credit card companies and financial institutions demonstrate CRED's ability to collaborate with key stakeholders in the industry.

By analyzing these metrics regularly and making data-driven decisions, CRED can continuously improve its platform, enhance user experience, and achieve its business goals. Successful growth in these areas will indicate that CRED is effectively delivering value to both credit card users and its partner companies.
