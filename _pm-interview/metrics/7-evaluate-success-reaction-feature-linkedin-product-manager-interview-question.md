## Measure the success of the LinkedIn reactions feature 

<img src="../assets/like.png" />


As human emotions, aren't always binary; LinkedIn just like Facebook launched the reaction feature on its platform. I will take this question as a Product Management Interview question as I was asked recently in a PM interview, and I will evaluate the impact of this feature and the impact it puts on the entire LinkedIn ecosystem separately.


I would divide to divide of the goal of using this feature into two verticals.


### 1. Customer Goal 🍮

- **Providing customers with more options in addition to “Like” to express themselves –** Human emotions have a wide range and variety. It isn’t binary. The Like button limits the range of emotions that someone can express while engaging with content on their news feed.

- **Increasing social validation**. **Giving users more ways to quickly and constructively communicate with one another** – When users post on LinkedIn, they want more ways to feel heard and understand why someone has liked what they have said.

### 2. Business goal 🧑‍💼

- **Increase engagement of users on the news feed- By engagement, I mean – the** average number of shares, posts, likes, reactions, comments per visitor during a 30-day period.

- **Retention** – For the test group that is exposed to reactions. – Do we see higher repeat visits (to see how their friends have reacted to their posts/shares or if others have liked/reacted to posts that they have liked/reacted)




### Testing the reaction feature 🖥️

---

I would use the following three metrics to test the feature of reactions.

- 🏸 **Discoverability/Acquisition:** *Are people able to discover “Reactions”?* It is currently hidden under the Like button- is it easily discoverable?

- 🎢 **Usage:** *For the visitors that discover Reactions – How many people are clicking on the reactions?* What is the total number of clicks? I would measure this for at least a
week. I would also measure the % of users who are using
likes compared to reactions?

- 🤘🏼**Usage by reaction type:** How many clicks per reaction type? *This would help me understand if I even have the right set of reactions in there or do, I need different reactions?*



### Testing the impact of reactions on the entire ecosystem 😻

---

- 🎮 **Usage/Engagement/Content Creation –** For the user group that is exposed to reactions (Test Group)– does their average activity during a 30 day period increase due to reactions – Are
they liking/reacting/commenting/sharing more as compared to people (Control group) who do not see reactions? Are they creating more content than before the test (pre-post analysis) and as compared to the control group (A/B)?

- 🦋 **Retention –** For the test group that is exposed to reactions – do we see higher repeat visits (to see how their friends have reacted to their posts/shares or if others have liked/reacted to posts that they have liked/reacted)

- 🐧 **Engagement –** Does it increase the time spent and length of the scroll on the news feed? Test A/B and see if there is a statistically significant difference?

- 💲**Monetization** – Is there a higher click-thru rate (CTR) on ads for visitors who were exposed to reactions?

**Interviewer (I):** You mentioned A/B testing many a time. How would you prevent the control group from seeing reactions in their feed if their friends are in the test group?

**Response:**
- I would ensure that the control and test groups are far apart in the LinkedIn social graph.
- If they are in the same social graph and reactions are encountered by the
control group, I would ask the engineering team to convert the reactions to like for the test groups.

**Interviewer (I):** How would you differentiate that whether passive users have become active or active users or highly socially engaged people” also had a marked improvement in their social activity due to the launch of this feature.

**Response:** To measure incremental improvement in engagement, I would take people in test and control groups with similar levels of prior engagement and then compare both.
