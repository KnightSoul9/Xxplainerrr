## Estimate the number of Whatsapp messages sent in a day?

This question is related to guess estimation, and it can also be asked in different form like, "How many Whatsapp messages are sent in Delhi every day?" ? Let's take a look at how you can approach this problem.

### Step 1 - Ask clarifying questions and narrow down the scope of the question

---

- Observe the question (carefully!) and when I say this, I mean it.
- Itâ€™s important to understand the question first. The question talks about estimating the number of WhatsApp messages sent in a day
- The interviewer has narrowed the dimension of the question for you by asking **for a day**. Nice!!
- But you need to simplify this much further (bruhh!)
  - Should you estimate it for particular geographies like India or Bangalore?
  - Should you estimate 1:1 messages, or include group messages, or Whatsapp business messages?

ðŸ’¡ Pro-tip: Always ask clarifying questions first. You can ask the interviewer that in which direction should you approach but I would recommend you to keep the dimension of the question utmost simple.

You can say to the interviewer that for the simplicity of this question, I would want to consider Whatsapp messages sent in Delhi only. Will it be okay? (Trust me! More often than not, the interviewer will agree)

### Step 2 - Break it down

---

- To send Whatsapp messages; you need to have a smartphone and after that, you need to have Whatsapp installed?
  - So first, you need to find how many smartphones exist in Delhi?
  - And then, how many smartphones have Whatsapp installed in them?

### A. Finding smartphones in Delhi

### B. Finding the number of Whatsapp installed on smartphones

Let's assume that 80% of all smartphones have Whatsapp installed for peer-to-peer messaging.

So, the number of smartphones with Whatsapp installed in Delhi = 80% of 7.5 M = 6 M

### Step 3 - Break it down further

---

The objective of a guess-estimate question is to understand whether you can break the question into smaller parts and then visualize the complete picture.

Since we have estimated the total Whatsapp user in Delhi to be 6M, you can further segment the user on the basis of their usage type - heavy users, casual users, and infrequent users.

And you can take a number for the average number of messages sent per user group.

ðŸ’¡ While solving this question, we have taken x messages per user group (i.e. 150 for heavy users, 75 for casual users, and 20 for infrequent users) randomly. You can have a discussion with the interviewer that do you need to break it down further?

If the interviewer says yes, you need to it down further (i.e. 1:1 messages sent, messages sent on the group) and then 1:1 messages sent can be also be divided further into (close contacts, official conversations, etc.)

And then you can quote a number like 150, 75, 20, etc.
