          "I currently work as a Product Manager at South East Asia’s leading fintech start-up - Razorpay. Prior to Razorpay, I led pricing & monetisation at an HR tech startup - Internshala. I was the Product Manager who ideated pricing strategy & launched subscriptions, bundled pricing, and tiered pricing. We saw 3x growth in MRR in 4 months.\n\nWhen I started working on the growth, pricing and monetisation problem at Internshala, I needed more resources to learn about pricing and monetisation but couldn’t find much. I saw a program on Reforge but it was worth $1500.\n\nHence, I started making notes on my own of my learnings and published them as a blog series. Half a million people read those blogs. After Blitz scaling the monetisation and growth at Internshala by learning from first principles, I have condensed all my learnings & notes in the form of this course. I hope you will find the course extremely useful.",
