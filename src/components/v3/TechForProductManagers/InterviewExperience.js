          It was a sunny day in 2018, and I had flown to Hyderabad for my Google
          PM interview. Google usually does screening rounds before inviting for
          onsite interviews. I had terrific feedback in the screening rounds.

          In the onsite interviews, Google tests various hats of PMs -
          analytical, product design, business, strategy, and tech. I had
          prepared well for all, or at least I thought I had ðŸ™‚
        </p>
        <p>
          The first onsite interview happened to be the technical round. I come
          from a chemical engineering background and donâ€™t have coding
          experience. At various times, I had tried to learn Javascript, HTML,
          Python, etc., rather unsuccessfully because there was never enough
          incentive to do so. In preparation for Googleâ€™s technical round, I had
          covered the data structure and algorithm basics plus the system design
          questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interviewer gave me one algorithm problem and one system design. I
          solved the algorithm problem. In the system design question, I mumbled
          a few things for the next 5 mins â€” sharding, database, table
          structures, etc. The interview got over quicker than expected, and I
          knew that my chances of cracking Google were over.
